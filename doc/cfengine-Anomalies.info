Overview
********

   One of the aims of cfengine version 2, in combination with our
research efforts at Oslo University College, is to develop a real
computer immune system, based on the detection of `sicknesses' or
anomalies in the behaviour of the system, not merely based on a policy
template. Such a system would be far more dynamical and be able to
change in response to changing external conditions. This work is in its
early stages, but you can take advantage of it straight away, with a
minimum of effort. This additional manual aims at getting you started,
so that you can monitor systems, and learn about their behaviour,
without having to watch control panels, or time-series traces.

An environment detector: cfenvd
===============================

   The `cfenvd' program serves two purposes: as an anomaly detection
engine and as a source of entropy for generating random numbers, such
as for encryption keys. Although it is not a compulsory part of
cfengine, it is highly recommended to run this daemon. It requires few
resources and poses no vulnerability to the system. It will play an
increasingly important role in future developments.

   In cfengine 2.x, additional classes are automatically evaluated
based on the state of the host, in relation to earlier times.  This is
accomplished by the additional `cfenvd' daemon, which continually
updates a database of system averages and variances, which characterize
"normal" behaviour. The state of the system is examined and compared to
the database, and the state is classified in terms of the current level
of activity, as compared to an average of equivalent earlier times. e.g.

     RootProcs_low_dev2
     netbiosssn_in_low_dev2
     smtp_out_high_anomalous
     www_in_high_dev3

   The first of these tells us that the number of root processes is two
standard deviations below the average of past behaviour, which might be
fortuitous, or might signify a problem, such as a crashed server.  The
WWW item tells us that the number of incoming connections is three
standard deviations above average. The smtp item tells us that outgoing
smtp connections are more than three standard deviations above average,
perhaps signifying a mail flood.  The setting of these classes is
transparent to the user, but the additional information is only visible
to the privileged owner of the cfengine work-directory, where the data
are cached.

   Active incoming ports are also registered as "pin-portnumber", but
this is mainly an experimental feature for future research. The
resulting class list, obtained from exploring the environment of the
system, and after parsing a configuration, looks something like this:

     host% cfagent -p -v
     
     [snip]
     
     Defined Classes = ( any Thursday Hr14 Min24 Min20_25

     pin-983 pin-10 )
     
     [snip]
   It is not yet known how the extra environment classes will be used in
practice.  One obvious possibility is to limit certain heavy-weight
operations (such as file tree scans) when the host is very busy, and to
increase the probability of their occurrence when the host is lightly
loaded. See the example in section 11.  It remains to be seen how users
will respond to these possibilities.

Anomaly research
================

   There is no system available in the world today which can claim to
detect and classify the functioning state of a computer system.
Cfengine does not attempt to provide a "product" solution to this
problem; rather it incorporates a framework, based on the current state
of knowledge, for continuing research into this issue.  In version 2.x
of cfengine, an extra daemon `cfenvd' is used to collect statistical
data about the recent history of each host (approximately the past two
months), and classify it in a way that can be utilized by the cfengine
agent.

   The daemon may simply be started, with no arguments:
     cfenvd
   and it proceeds to collect data and work autonomously, without
further supervision. The cf-environment daemon is meant be trivial to
use. The current long-term data recorded by the daemon are: number of
users, number of root processes, number of non-root processes,
percentage disk full for root disk, number of incoming and outgoing
sockets for netbiosns, netbiosdgm, netbiosssn, irc, cfengine, nfsd,
smtp, www, ftp, ssh and telnet. These data have been studied
previously, and their behaviour is relatively well understood. In
future versions, it is expected to extend this repertoire, as more
research is done.

   The use of the daemon will not be reliable until about six to eight
weeks after installing and running it, since a suitable training period
is required to build up enough data for stable characterization. The
daemon automatically adapts to the changing conditions, but has a
built-in inertia which prevents anomalous signals from being given too
much credence.  Persistent changes will gradually change the `normal
state' of the host over an interval of a few weeks. Unlike some
systems, cfengine's training period never ends.  It regards normal
behaviour as a relative concept, which has more to do with local
stability than global constancy.

   The final size of the database is approximately 2MB. Measurements are
taken every five minutes (approximately). This interval is based on
auto-correlation times measured for networked hosts in practice.

   Cfenvd sets a number of classes in cfengine which describe the
current state of the host in relation to its recent history. The classes
describe whether a parameter is above or below its average value, and
how far from the average the current value is, in units of the
standard-deviation (see above). This information could be utilized to
arrange for particularly resource-intensive maintenance to be delayed
until the expected activity was low.

cfenvgraph
==========

   The `cfenvgraph' command can use used to dump a graph of averages for
visual inspection of the normal state database. The format of the file
is
     t,y_1,y_2,y_3...

which can be viewed using `gnuplot' or `xgmr' or other graphical
plotting program.  This would allow the policy-maker to see what is
likely to be a good time for such work (say 06:00 hours), and then use
this time for the job, unless an anomalous load is detected.

   The cfenvgraph command is used to extract data from the database
used by the cfenvd environment daemon.
     cfenvgraph -f FILENAME.DB [-R -T -T -S -E]
   The command normally generates two files with format
     t, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4...
   in a sub-directory of the current directory `cfenvgraphs-snapshot'
(or `cfenvgraphs-'TIMESTAMP if `-T' is used).

   The files are called
     cfenv-average
     cfenv-stddev
   and contain, respectively, the weighted average values of all the
recorded data and the square-root of the weighted variances with respect
to the averages. Data are weighted in such a way that older values are
gradually deprecated, becoming irrelevant after about two months.

   Normally the vertical scale of each graph is scaled so that each line
has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of 0, this allows all the
lines to be seen in maximum detail. However, this makes it difficult to
see the absolute values of the lines. With the `-n' option, no scaling
is performed and true values are plotted.

   The complete data span a one-week period, and the daily rhythm of
the system may normally be viewed as a number of peaks, one per day.

   The options are:
`--help (-h)'
     List command options

`--file (-f)'
     Specifiy file to plot.

`--titles (-t)'
     If the `-t' option is given, comments are generated at the start
     of the file which describe the columns. These are in a format
     understood by  `vvgraph' as title/label data.

`--timestamps (-T)'
     If the `-T' option is given, the output filenames are time-stamped
     with the current time, in order to give a unique name.

`--resolution (-r)'
     If the `-r' option is given then high resolution data are generated
     (five minute resolution), otherwise data are averaged over periods
     of one hour to generate simpler and smoother graphs.

`--separate (-s)'
     If the `-s' option is given, cfenvgraph generates separate files
     for each metric, in the format
          t,y,dy
     where dy is the height of a vertical error-bar. This set of graphs
     combines the average with the standard-deviation. (Note that the
     error bars show the standard-deviation, and not the standard error
     of the mean i.e. stddev/sqrt(N)); the latter has no obvious
     meaning here.  If `-e' is specified, then error bars are omitted.

`--no-error-bars (-e)'
     No error bars are plotted.

`--no-scaling (-n)'
     The graphs are not scaled, so that (min,max) is mapped onto the
     interval (0,1).

   Note that the values printed for sockets always look higher than
they should for highly active services. This is because even those
sockets which are in CLOSE_WAIT are counted. This is the correct way to
determine a normal state based on the recent past. It is a local
averaging performed by the kernel. If one counts only those connections
which are currently active, one gets a distorted view of activity with
a 5-minute sample rate. To measure more often than this would place
unacceptably high load on the system.

   Graphs may be viewed in `vvgraph', `xmgr' (used in the pictures
above) or `gnuplot', or other graphical viewer. These graphs are not
meant for continuous viewing. The data are averages, not time-series.

   For example, with gnuplot

     host$ cfenvgraph -s
     host$ gnuplot
     gnuplot> plot "www-in.cfenv" with errorbars
     gnuplot> plot "www-in.cfenv" with lines
