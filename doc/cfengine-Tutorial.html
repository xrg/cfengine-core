<h3 class="section">What is cfengine and who can use it?</h3>

   <p>Cfengine is a tool for setting up and maintaining computer systems.  It
consists of several components:

<pre class="smallexample">      cfagent     - An autonomous configuration agent (required)
      cfservd     - A file server and remote activation service (optional)
      cfexecd     - A scheduling and report service (recommended)
      cfenvd      - An anomaly detection service (strongly recommended)
      cfenvgraph  - Ancillary tool for cfenvd (helper)
      cfkey       - Key generation tool (run once on every host)
     </pre>
   The agent <code>cfagent</code> can be used without the other components,
but not all of the functionality of cfengine will be available unless
the components are deployed appropriately.

   <p>Cfengine incorporates a declarative language--much higher
level than Perl or shell: a single statement can result in many hundreds
of operations being performed on multiple hosts. Cfengine is good at
performing a lot of common system administration tasks, and allows you
to build on its strengths with your own scripts. You can also use it as
a netwide front-end for <code>cron</code>.  Once you have set up cfengine,
you'll be free to use your time being like a human being, instead of
playing R2-D2 with the system.

   <p>The main purpose of cfengine is to allow you to create a single, central
system configuration which will define how every host on your network
should be configured in an intuitive way.  An interpreter runs on every
host on your network and parses the master file (or file-set); the
configuration of each host is checked against this file and then, if you
request it, any deviations from the defined configuration are fixed
automatically.  You do not have to mention every host specifically by
name in order to configure them: instead you can refer to the
properties which distinguish hosts from one another.  Cfengine uses a
flexible system of "classes" which helps you to single out a specific
group of hosts with a single statement.

   <p>Cfengine grew out of the need to control the accumulation of complex
shell scripts used in the automation of key system maintenance at
Oslo. There were very many scripts, written in shell and in perl,
performing tasks such as file tidying, find-database updates, process
checking and several other tasks.  In a heterogeneous environment,
shell-scripts work very poorly: shell commands have differing syntax
across different operating systems, the locations and names of key files
differ. In fact, the non-uniformity of Unix was a major
headache. Scripts were filled with tests to determine what kind of
operating system they were being run on, to the point where they became
so complicated an unreadable that no-one was quite sure what they did
anymore. Other scripts were placed only on the systems where they were
relevant, out of sight and out of mind.  It quickly became clear that
our dream solution would be to replace this proliferation of scripts by
a single file containing everything to be checked on every host on the
network. By defining a new language, this file could hide all of the
tests by using classes (a generalized `switch/case' syntax) to label
operations and improve the readability greatly. The gradual refinement
of this idea resulted in the present day cfengine.

   <p>As an inexperienced cfengine user, you will probably find yourself
trying to do things as you would have tried to do them i Shell or Perl. 
This is probably not the right way to think, when using cfengine. You will
need to think in a more `cfengine way'. When reading the manual, keep
in mind that cfengine's way of working is to think about what the final
result should be like, rather than on how to get there (with Shell and Perl
you specify what to do, rather than what you would like).

   <p>The remainder of this manual assumes that you know a little about
BSD/System-5 systems and have everyday experience in using either the
C-shell or the Bourne shell, or their derivatives.  If you are
experienced in system administration, you might like to skip the earlier
chapters and turn straight to the example in the section <em>Example
configuration file</em> of the Reference manual.  This is the probably
quickest way to learn cfengine for the initiated.  If you are not so
familiar with system administration and would like a more gentle
introduction, then we begin here...

<h3 class="section">Site configuration</h3>

   <p>To the system administrator of a small network, with just a few
workstations or perhaps even a single mainframe system, it might seem
superfluous to create a big fuss about the administration of the system. 
After all, it's easy to `fix' things manually should any problems
arise, making a link here, writing a script there and so on -- and its
probably not even worth writing down what you did because you know that
it will always be easy to fix next time around too...  But networks have
a tendency to expand and--before you know it--you have five different
types of operating system and each type of system has to be configured
in a special way, you have to make patches to each system and you can't
remember whether you fixed that host on the other side of the
building...  Also, you discover fairly quickly that what you thought of
as BSD or System 5 is not as standard as you thought and that none of
your simple scripts that worked on one system work on the others without
a considerable amount of hacking and testing.  You try writing a script
to help you automate the task, but end up with an enormous number of
<code>if..then..else..</code> tests which make it hard to see what is really
going on.

   <p>To manage a network with many different flavours of operating system, in
a systematic way, what is needed is a more disciplined way of making
changes which is robust against re-installation.  After all, it would be
tragic to spend many hours setting up a system by hand only to lose
everything in an unfortunate disk-crash a week or even a year later when
you have forgotten what you had to do.  Upgrades of the operating system
software might delete your carefully worked out configuration.  What is
needed is a separate record of all of the patches required on all of the
systems on the network; a record which can be compared to the state of
each host at any time and which a suitable engine can use to fix any
deviations from that reference standard.

   <p>The idea behind cfengine is to focus upon a few key areas of basic
system administration and provide a language in which the
transparency of a configuration program is optimal.  It eliminates the
need for lots of tests by allowing you to organize your network
according to "classes".  From a single configuration file (or set of
files) you can specify how your network should be configured -- and
cfengine will then parse your file and carry out the instructions,
warning or fixing errors as it goes.

<h4 class="subsection">Configuration files and registries</h4>

   <p>One of the endearing characteristics of BSD and system 5 systems is
that they are configured through human-readable text files.  To add a
new user to the system you edit <code>/etc/passwd</code>, to add a new
disk you must edit <code>/etc/fstab</code> etc.  Many applications are also
configured with the help of text files.  When installing a new system
for the first time, or when changing updating the setup of an old system
you are faced with having to edit lots of files.  In some cases you will
have to add precisely the same line to the same file on every system in
your network as a change is made, so it is handy to have a way of
automating this procedure so that you don't have to load every file into
an editor by hand and make the changes yourself.  This is one of the
tasks which cfagent will automate for you.

   <p>On Windows systems, configuration data are stored in a system registery. 
This can also be edited by cfengine, with the right tools, but this
requires more care.

<br>

<h4 class="subsection">Network interface</h4>

   <p>Each host which you connect to an ethernet-based network running TCP/IP
protocols must have a so-called `net interface'.  This network interface
must be configured before it will work.  Normally one does this with the
help of the <code>ifconfig</code> command.  This can also be checked and
configured automatically by cfagent.

   <p>Network configuration involves telling the interface hardware what the
internet (IP) address of your system is, so that it knows which incoming
`packets' of data to pay attention to.  It involves telling the
interface how to interpret the addresses it receives by setting the
`netmask' for your network (see below).  Finally you must tell it which
dummy address is to be used for messages which are broadcast to all
hosts on your network simultaneously (see the reference manual).

   <p>Cfagent's features are mainly meant for hosts which use static IP addresses,
if you are using DHCP clients then you will not need the net configuration
features.

<h4 class="subsection">Network File System (NFS) or file distribution?</h4>

   <p>Probably the first thing you are interested in doing with a network
(after you've had your fill of the world wide web) is to make your files
available to some or all hosts on the network, no matter where in your
corporate empire (or university dungeon) you might be sitting.  In other
words, if you have a disk which is physically connected to host A, you
would like to make the contents of that disk available to hosts B, C,
D...  etc.  NFS (the network filesystem) does this for you.  The process
works by `filesystems'.

   <p>A filesystem is one partition of a disk drive - or one unit of disk
space which can be accessed by a single `logical device'
<code>/dev/something</code>.  To make a filesystem available to other hosts
you have to do three things.

     <ul>
<li>On the host the disk is physically connected to you must <em>export</em> the filesystem
by adding something to the file <code>/etc/exports</code>.  This tells NFS who
is allowed to access the disk and who isn't.

     <li>On the host which is to access the filesystem you must create a mount point.  This
is a name in the directory tree at which you want to add the files to
your local filesystem.

     <li>On the host which is to access the files you must mount the filesystem onto the
mount point.  The mount operation is the jargon for telling the system
to access the device on which the data are stored.  Mounting is
analogous to opening a file: files are opened, filesystems are mounted. 
</ul>

<p>Only after all three of these have been done will a filesystem become
available across the network.  Cfagent will help you with the last two
in a very transparent way.  You could also use the text-editing facility
in cfagent to edit the exports file, but there are other ways update
the exports file using <em>netgroups</em> which we shall not go into here. 
If you are in doubt, look up the manual page on exports.

   <p>Some sites prefer to minimize the use of NFS filesystems, to
avoid one machine being dependent on another. They prefer to
make a local copy of the files on a remote machine instead. 
Traditionally programs like <code>rdist</code> have been used for
this purpose. You may also use cfagent to copy files in this
way, See <a href="#Emulating%20rdist">Emulating rdist</a>.

Up:<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Key%20concepts">Key concepts</a>
<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">Name servers (DNS)</h4>

   <p>There are two ways to specify addresses on the internet (called IP
addresses).  One is to use the textual address like <code>ftp.uu.net</code>
and the other is to use the numerical form <code>192.48.96.9</code>.  Alas,
there is no one-to-one correspondence between the numerical addresses
and the textual ones, thus a service is required to map one to the
other.

   <p>The service is performed by one or more special hosts on the network
called <em>nameservers</em>.  Each host must know how to contact a
nameserver or it will probably hang the first time you give it an IP
address.  You tell it how to contact a nameserver by editing the
text-file <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>.  This file must contain the domain
name for your domain and a list of possible nameservers which can be
contacted, in order of priority.  Because this is a special file which
every host must have, you don't have to use the editing facilities in
cfagent explicitly.  You can just define the nameservers for each host
in the cfagent file and cfagent will do the editing automatically.  If
you want to change the priority of nameservers later, or even change the
list then a simple change of one or two lines in the configuration file
will enable you to reconfigure every host on your network automatically
without having to do any editing yourself!

<h4 class="subsection">Monitoring important files</h4>

   <p>Security is an important issue on any system.  In the busy life of a
system administrator it is not always easy to remember to set the correct
access rights on every file and this can result in either a security
breach or problems in accessing files.

   <p>A common scenario is that you, as administrator, fetch a new package
using ftp, compile it and install it without thinking too carefully. 
Since the owner and permissions of the files in an ftp archive remains
those of the program author, it often happens that the software is left
lying around with the owner and permissions as set by the author of the
program rather than any user-name on <em>your</em> system.  The user-id of
the author might be anybody on your system -- or perhaps nobody at all! 
The files should clearly be owned by root and made readable and
unwritable to normal users.

   <p>Simple accidents and careless actions under stress could result in, say,
the password file being writable to ordinary users.  If this were the
case, the security of the entire system would be compromised.  Cfagent
therefore allows you to monitor the permissions, ownership and general
existence of files and directories and, if you wish, correct them or
warn about them automatically.

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">Making links</h4>

   <p>One of the difficulties with having so many different variations on the
theme of BSD and system 5 based operating systems is that similar files
are not always where you expect to find them.  They have different names
or lie in different directories.  The usual solution to the problem is
to make an alias for these files, or a pointer from one filename to
another.  The name for such an alias is a <em>symbolic link</em>.

   <p>It is often very convenient to make symbolic links.  For example, you
might want the sendmail configuration file <code>/etc/sendmail.cf</code> to be
a link to a global configuration file, say,
<pre class="smallexample">     <code>/usr/local/mail/etc/sendmail.cf</code>
     </pre>

<p>on every single host on your network so that there is only one file to
edit.  If you had to make all of these links yourself, it would take a
lifetime.  Cfagent will make such a link automatically and check it
each time it is run.  You can also ask it to tidy up old links which
have been left around and no longer point to existing files.  If you
reinstall your operating system later it doesn't matter because all your
links are defined in your cfagent configuration file, recorded for all
time.  Cfengine won't forget it, and you won't forget it because the
setup is defined in one central place.

   <p>Cfagent will also allow you to make hard links to regular files, but
not other kinds of file. A hard link to a symbolic link, is the same
as a hard link to the file the symbolic link points to.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Functionality</h3>

   <p>The notes above give you a rough idea of what cfengine can be used for. 
Here is a summary of cfagent's capabilities.

     <ul>

     <li>Check and configure the network interface.

     <li>Edit textfiles for the system and for all users.

     <li>Make and maintain symbolic links, including multiple links from
a single command.

     <li>Check and set the permissions and ownership of files.

     <li>Tidy (delete) junk files which clutter the system.

     <li>Systematic, automated mounting of NFS filesystems.

     <li>Checking for the presence of important files and filesystems.

     <li>Controlled execution of user scripts and shell commands.

     <li>Cfengine follows a class-based decision structure.

     <li>Process management.

   </ul>

   <p>How do you run cfagent? You can run it as a cron job, or you can run it
manually. You may run cfagent scripts/programs as often
as you like.  Each time you run a script, the engine determines whether
anything needs to be done -- if nothing needs to be done, nothing is
done!  If you use it to monitor and configure your entire network from a
central file-base, then the natural thing is to run cfengine repeatedly with
the help of <code>cron</code> and/or <code>cfexecd</code>.

<h3 class="section">What you must have in a cfagent program</h3>

   <p>A cfagent configuration file for a large network can become long and complex
so, before we get down to details, let's try to strip away the complexity
and look only to the essentials.

   <p>Each cfagent program or configuration file is a list of declarations of
items to be checked and perhaps fixed.  You begin by creating a file
called <code>cfagent.conf</code>.  The simplest meaningful file you can
create is something like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     # Comment...
     
     control:
     
       actionsequence = ( links )
     
     links:
     
       /bin -&gt; /usr/bin
     
     </pre>

<p>The
example above checks and makes (if necessary) a link from <code>/bin</code> to <code>/usr/bin</code>. 
Let's examine this example more closely.  In a cfengine program:

     <ul>

     <li>Use of space is unrestricted.  You can start new lines wherever you like. 
You should generally have a space before and after parentheses to avoid
confusing the parser.

     <li>A comment is some text which is ignored by cfengine.  The <code>#</code> symbol
designates a comment and means: ignore the remaining text on this line. 
A comment symbol must have a space in front of it, or start a new line
so that cfengine knows you don't mean the symbol as part of another
word.

     <li>Words which end in a single colon define <em>sections</em> in a program.  Under a
given section you group together all declarations of a given type.  Section names
must all be taken from a list defined by the language.  You cannot define your
own sections.

     <li>Words which end in two colons are so-called <em>class</em> names.  They are
used for making decisions in cfengine.

     <li>Statements which are of the form <code></code><var>name</var><code>=( </code><var>list</var><code> )</code> are
used to assign the value on the right hand side to the name on the left hand side
of the equals sign.

   </ul>

<p>In simple example above has three of the four types of object described
above.  The <code>control:</code> section of any program tells cfengine how to
behave.  In this example it adds the action <var>links</var> to the
actionsequence.  For <var>links</var> you could replace some other action. 
The essential point is that, if you don't have an action sequence, your
cfengine program will do absolutely nothing! The action sequence is a
list which tells cfagent what do to and in which order.

   <p>The <code>links:</code> section of the file tells cfagent that what follows
is a number of links to be made.  If you write this part of the file,
but forget to add links to the actionsequence, then nothing will be
done! You can add any number of links in this part of the file and they
will all be dealt with in order when--and only when--you write
<var>links</var> in the action sequence.

   <p>To summarize, you <em>must</em> have:

     <ul>

     <li>Some declarations which specify things to be done.

     <li>An action sequence which tells cfagent which sections to process,
how many times and in which order they should be processed.

   </ul>

   <p>Now let's think a bit about how useful this short example program is. 
On a SunOS system, where the directory <code>/bin</code> is in fact supposed
to be a link, such a check could be useful, but on some other system
where <code>/bin</code> is a not a link but a separate directory, this would
result in an error message from cfagent, telling you that <code>/bin</code>
exists and is not a link.  The lesson is that, if we want to use
cfagent to make <em>one single</em> program which can be run on any host
of any type, then we need some way of restricting the above link so that
it only gets checked on SunOS systems.  We can write the following:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     # Comment...
     
     control:
     
       actionsequence = ( links  )
     
     links:
     
       sun4::
     
            /bin -&gt; /usr/bin
            # other links
     
        osf::
     
            # other links
     
     </pre>

<p>The names which have double colons after them are called <em>classes</em>
and they are used to restrict a particular action so that it only gets
performed if the host running the program is a member of that class.  If
you are familiar with C++, this syntax should make you think of classes
definitions in C++.  Classes works like this: the names above
<code>sun4</code>, <code>sun3</code>, <code>osf</code> etc.  are all internally defined by
cfagent.  If a host running, say, the OSF operating system executes the
file it automatically becomes a member of the class <code>osf</code>.  Since
it cannot be a member more than one of the above, this distinguishes
between different types of operating system and creates a hidden
<code>if</code>..<code>then</code>...<code>else</code> test.

   <p>This is the way in which cfagent makes decisions.  The key idea is that
actions are only carried out if they are in the same class as the host
running the program.  Classes are dealt with in detail in the next
chapter.

   <p>Now let's see how to add another kind of action to the action sequence.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     # Comment...
     
     control:
     
       actionsequence = ( tidy links )
     
     links:
     
       /bin -&gt; /usr/bin
     
     tidy:
     
        /tmp  pattern=* age=7 recurse=inf
     
     </pre>

<p>We have now added a new kind of declaration called <code>tidy:</code> which
deletes files.  In the example above, we are looking at files in the
directory <code>/tmp</code> which match the pattern <code>*</code> and have not been
accessed for more than seven days.  The search for these files descends
recursively down any number of subdirectories.

   <p>To make any of this happen we must add the word <var>tidy</var> to the action
sequence.  If we don't, the declaration will be ignored.  Notice also
that, regardless of the fact that <code>links:</code> comes before
<code>tidy:</code>, the order in the action sequence tells us that all
<code>tidy</code> actions will be performed before <code>links:</code>.

   <p>The above structure can be repeated to build up a configuration file or script.

<h3 class="section">Program structure</h3>

   <p>To summarize the previous section, here is a sketch of a typical
cfagent configuration program showing a sensible structure.  The
various sections are listed in a sensible order which you would probably
use in the action sequence.

   <p>An individual section-declaration in the program looks something like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     <var>action-type</var>:
     
        <var>class1</var>::
     
            <var>list of things to do...</var>
     
        <var>class2</var>::
     
            <var>list of things to do...</var>
     
     </pre>

<p><code>action-type</code> is one of the following reserved words:

<pre class="smallexample">     
        groups, control, homeservers, binservers, mailserver, mountables,
        import, broadcast, resolve, defaultroute, directories, miscmounts,
        files, ignore, tidy, required, links, disable, shellcommands,
        editfiles, processes
     
     </pre>

<p>The order in which declarations occur is not important to cfengine from
a syntactical point of view, but some of the above actions define
information which you will want to refer to later.  All variables,
classes, groups etc.  must be defined before they are used.  That means
that it is smart to follow the order above for the sections in the first
line of the above list.

   <p>The order in which items are declared is not to be confused with the
order in which they are executed.  This is determined by the
<code>actionsequence</code>, (see the reference manual).  Probably you will want to
coordinate the two so that they match as far as possible.

   <p>For completeness, here is a complete summary of the structure of a very
general cfagent configuration program.  The format is free and use of
space is unrestricted, though it is always a good idea to put a space in
front before and after parentheses when defining variables.

<h3 class="section">Building a distributed configuration</h3>

<p>If a configuration is to be specified at one central location,
how does it get distributed to many hosts? The simple answer
is to get cfengine to distribute the configuration to the
hosts. To do that, a separate configuration file is used. Why?

   <p>Imagine what would happen if you made a mistake in the configuration,
i.e. a syntax error which got distributed to every host. Now all
the hosts wuld be unable to run cfengine, and thereafter unable
to download a corrected configuration file. The whole setup would
be broken. To prevent this kind of accident, a separate configuration
file is used to copy the files and binaries to each host. This
configuration should be simple, and should almost never be edited:
they key word here is <em>reliability</em>.

<h3 class="section">Optional features in cfagent</h3>

   <p>Cfagent doesn't do anything unless you ask it to.  When you run a
cfagent program it generates no output unless it finds something it
believes to be wrong.  It does not carry out any actions unless they are
declared in the action sequence.

   <p>If you like, though, you can make cfagent positively chatty.  Cfagent can be
run with a number of command line options (see the reference manual).  If
you run the program with the <code>-v</code> or <code>--verbose</code> options, it
will supply you cheerily with a resume of what it is doing.  Certain
warning messages also get printed in verbose mode, so it is a useful debugging tool.

   <p>You can ask cfagent to check lots of things - the timezone for
instance, or the domain name.  In order for it to check these things, it
needs some information from you.  All of the switches and options which
change the way in which cfagent behaves get specified either on the
command line or in the <code>control:</code> section of the control file. 
Some special control variables are used for this purpose.  Here is a
short example:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
       domain   = ( example.org )
       netmask  = ( 255.255.255.0 )
       timezone = ( MET CET )
     
       mountpattern = ( /mydomain/mountpoint )
     
       actionsequence =
          (
          checktimezone     # check time zone
          netconfig         # includes check netmask
          resolve           # includes domain
          mountinfo         # look for mounted disks under mountpattern
          )
     
     </pre>

<p>To get verbose output you must run cfagent with the appropriate command
line option <code>--verbose</code> or <code>-v</code>.

   <p>Notice that setting values has a special kind of syntax: a variable
name, an equals sign and a value in parentheses.  This tells you that
the quantity of the left hand side assumes the value on the right hand
side.  There are lots of questions you might ask at this point.  The
answers to these will be covered as we go along and in the next chapter.

   <p>Before leaving this brief advertisement for control parameters, it is
worth noting the definition of <code>mountpattern</code> above.  This declares
a directory in which cfagent expects to find mounted disks.  It will be
explained in detail later, for now notice that this definition looks
rather stupid and inflexible.  It would be much better if we could use
some kind of variables to define where to look for mounted filesystems. 
And of course you can...

   <p>Having briefly scraped the surface of what cfagent can do, turn to the
example and take a look at what a complete program can look like,
(see the reference manual).  If you understand it, you might like
to skip through the rest of the manual until you find what you are
looking for.  If it looks mysterious, then the next chapter should
answer some questions in more depth.

<div class="node">

<h3 class="section">Invoking cfagent</h3>

   <p>Cfagent may be invoked in a number of ways.  Here are some examples:

<pre class="example">     host% cfagent
     
     host% cfagent --file myfile
     
     host% cfagent -f myfile -v -n
     
     host% cfagent --help
     </pre>

   <p>The first of these (the default command, with no arguments) causes
cfagent to look for a file called <code>cfagent.conf</code> in the directory
pointed to by the environment variables <code>CFINPUTS</code>
or <code>/var/cfengine/inputs</code> by default,
and execute it silently.  The second command reads the file
<code>myfile</code> and works silently.  The third works in verbose mode and
the <code>-n</code> option means that no actions should actually be carried
out, only warnings should be printed.  The final example causes cfagent
to print out a list of its command line options.

   <p>The complete list of options is listed in the summary at the beginning
of this manual, or you can see it by giving the <code>-h</code> option,
(see the reference manual).

   <p>In addition to running cfagent with a filename, you can also treat
cfagent files as scripts by starting your cfagent program with the
standard shell line:
<pre class="smallexample">     #!/usr/local/sbin/cfagent -f
     #
     # My config script
     #
     </pre>

<p>Here we assume that you have installed cfengine under the directory
<code>/usr/local/sbin</code>.  By adding a header like this to the first line
of your program and making the file executable with the <code>chmod</code>
shell command, you can execute the program just by typing its
name--i.e.  without mentioning cfengine explicitly at all.

   <p>As a novice to cfengine, it is advisable to check all programs with the
<code>-n</code> option before trusting them to your system, at least until you
are familiar with the behaviour of cfengine.  This `safe' option allows
you to see what cfengine wants to do, without actually committing
yourself to doing it.

<h3 class="section">Running cfengine permanently, monitoring and restarting cfexecd</h3>

   <p>Once you are happy using cfengine, you will want it to run least once
per hour on your systems. This is easily achieved by adding the following
line to the root crontab file of each system:
<pre class="smallexample">     0,30 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/cfexecd -F
     </pre>
   This is enough to ensure that cfengine will get run. Any output generated
by this job, will be stored in <code>/var/cfengine/outputs</code>. 
In addition, if you add the following to the file <code>cfagent.conf</code>,
the system administrator will be emailed a summary of any output:
<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
     smtpserver = ( mailhub.example.org ) # site MTA which can talk smtp
     sysadm     = ( mark@example.org )   # mail address of sysadm
     
     </pre>

<p>Fill in suitable values for these variables. 
An alternative, or additional way to run cfengine, is to run the <code>cfexecd</code>
program is daemon mode (without the <code>-F</code>) option. In this mode, the daemon
lives in the background and sleeps, activating only in accordance with
a scheduling policy. The default policy is to run once every hour (equivalent
to <code>Min00_05</code>). Here is how you would modify <code>cfagent.conf</code> in
order to make the daemon execute cfagent every half-hour:
<pre class="smallexample">      control:
     
        # When should cfexecd in daemon mode wake up the agent?
     
        schedule   = ( Min00_05 Min30_35 )
     </pre>
   Note that the time specifications are the basic cfengine <em>time classes</em>,
See <a href="#Building%20flexible%20time%20classes">Building flexible time classes</a>. 
Although one of these methods should suffice,
no harm will arise from running both cron and the cfexecd side-by-side. 
Cfagents locking mechanisms ensure that no contention will occur.

   <p>The other components of cfengine can be started by cfagent itself:
<pre class="smallexample">     processes:
     
      "cfenvd"  restart "/usr/local/sbin/cfenvd"
      "cfservd" restart "/usr/local/sbin/cfservd"
     
     </pre>
   Note that, to start cfexecd by cfengine, one must do this
<pre class="smallexample">     processes:
     
      "cfexecd$"  restart "/usr/local/sbin/cfexecd"
     
     </pre>
   If cfagent is run by <code>cfexecd -F</code> then this process will match and prevent
execution unless the <code>$</code> regular expression is used to make the match exact.

<h3 class="section">CFINPUTS environment variable</h3>

   <p>Whenever cfengine looks for a file it asks a question: is the filename
an absolute name (that is a name which begins from <code>/</code> like
<code>/usr/file</code>), is it a file in the directory in which you invoke
cfengine or is it a file which should be searched for in a special
place?

   <p>If you use an absolute filename either on the command line using
<code>-f</code> or in the <code>import</code> section of your program (a name which
begins with a slash '/'), then cfengine trusts the name of the file you
have given and treats it literally. If you specify the name of the
file as simple <code>.</code> or <code>-</code> then cfengine reads its input from the
standard input.

   <p>If you run cfengine without arguments (so that the default filename is
<code>cfagent.conf</code>) or you specify a file without a leading slash in
the <code>import</code> section, then the value of the environment variable
<code>CFINPUTS</code> is prepended to the start of the file name.  This allows
you to keep your configuration in a standard place, pointed to by
<code>CFINPUTS</code>.  For example:

<pre class="example">     
     host# setenv CFINPUTS /usr/local/masterfiles/cfengine/inputs
     
     host# cfagent -f myfile
     </pre>

<p>In this example, cfengine tries to open
<code>/usr/local/masterfiles/cfengine/inputs/myfile</code>. 
If no value is set for <code>CFINPUTS</code>, then the default location
is the trusted cfengine directory
<code>/var/cfengine/inputs</code>.

<h3 class="section">What to aim for</h3>

   <p>If you are a beginner to cfengine, you might not be certain exactly how
you want to use it. Here are some hints from Dr. Daystrom about how to
get things working quickly.

     <ul>

     <li>Run cfengine from cron every hour on all your systems. Be sure to
label long tasks, or tasks which do not need to be performed often
by a <em>time class</em> which prevents it from being executed
all the time, See <a href="#Using%20cfengine%20as%20a%20front-end%20for%20cron">Using cfengine as a front-end for cron</a>.

     <p><em>Running cfengine from cron means that it will be run
in parallel on your systems. Cfengine on one host does not
have to wait for cfengine on another host to complete.</em>

     <li>Set up <code>cfservd</code> on all your systems so that cfengine can be executed
remotely, so that you can immediately "push" changes to all your
hosts with <code>cfrun</code>. Think carefully about whom you wish to give permission to run
cfengine from the net, See <a href="#Configuring%20cfservd">Configuring cfservd</a>. Set up you
<code>cfservd.conf</code> file accordingly. You can also use this daemon to
grant access rights for remote file copying.

     <p><em>Cfrun polls all your hosts serially and gives you a concatenated
indexed list of problems on all hosts. The disadvantage with cfrun is
that each host has to wait its turn.</em>

     <li>Don't forget to add <code>cfservd</code> to the system startup scripts, or to <code>inittab</code>
so that it starts when you boot your system.

     <li>Add <em>all</em> your hosts to the <code>cfrun.hosts</code> file. It does not
matter that some may be master servers and others clients. The locking
mechanisms will protect you from silliness, See <a href="#Deadlocks%20and%20runaway%20loops">Deadlocks and runaway loops</a>. Cfengine will work it out. Cfrun allows you to remotely execute
cfengine on groups of hosts which satisfy a list of cfengine classes.

   </ul>

<p>When you have set up these components, you can sit back and edit the
configuration files and watch things being done.

<h3 class="section">Classes</h3>

   <p>The idea of classes is central to the operation of cfengine.  Saying
that cfengine is `class orientated' means that it doesn't make decisions
using <code>if</code>...<code>then</code>...<code>else</code> constructions the way other
languages do, but only carries out an action if the host running the
program is in the same class as the action itself.  To understand what
this means, imagine sorting through a list of all the hosts at your
site.  Imagine also that you are looking for the <em>class</em> of hosts
which belong to the computing department, which run GNU/Linux operating
system and which have yellow spots! To figure out whether a particular
host satisfies all of these criteria you first delete all of the hosts
which are not GNU/Linux, then you delete all of the remaining ones which
don't belong to the computing department, then you delete all the
remaining ones which don't have yellow spots.  If you are on the
remaining list, then you are in the class of all
computer-science-Linux-yellow-spotted hosts and you can carry out the
action.

   <p>Cfengine works in this way, narrowing things down by asking if a host is
in several classes at the same time.  Although some information (like
the kind of operating system you are running) can be obtained directly,
clearly, to make this work we need to have lists of which hosts belong
to the computer department and which ones have yellow spots.

   <p>So how does this work in a cfengine program?  A program or configuration
script consists of a set of declarations for what we refer to as
<em>actions</em> which are to be carried out only for certain classes of
host.  Any host can execute a particular program, but only certain
action are extracted -- namely those which refer to that particular
host.  This happens automatically because cfengine builds up a list of
the classes to which it belongs as it goes along, so it avoids having to
make many decisions over and over again.

   <p>By defining classes which classify the hosts on your network in some
easy to understand way, you can make a single action apply to many hosts
in one go - i.e.  just the hosts you need.  You can make generic rules
for specific type of operating system, you can group together clusters
of workstations according to who will be using them and you can paint
yellow spots on them - what ever works for you.

   <p>A <em>cfengine action</em> looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     <var>action-type</var>:
     
        <var>compound-class</var>::
     
            <var>declaration</var>
     </pre>

<p>A single class can be one of several things:

     <ul>

     <li>The name of an operating system architecture e.g.  <code>ultrix</code>, <code>sun4</code> etc. 
This is referred to henceforth as a <em>hard class</em>.

     <li>The (unqualified) name of a particular host. If your system returns a fully
qualified domain name for your host, cfagent truncates it so as to unqualify
the name.

     <li>The name of a user-defined group of hosts.

     <li>A day of the week (in the form <code>Monday Tuesday Wednesday..</code>).

     <li>An hour of the day (in the form <code>Hr00, Hr01 ... Hr23</code>).

     <li>Minutes in the hour (in the form <code>Min00, Min17 ... Min45</code>).

     <li>A five minute interval in the hour (in the form <code>Min00_05, Min05_10 ... Min55_00</code>)

     <li>A quart hour (in the form <code>Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4</code>)

     <li>An abbreviated time with quarter hour specified (in the form <code>Hr00_Q1, Hr23_Q4</code> etc.)

     <li>A day of the month (in the form <code>Day1 ... Day31</code>).

     <li>A month (in the form <code>January, February, ... December</code>).

     <li>A year (in the form <code>Yr1997, Yr2001</code>).

     <li>An arbitrary user-defined string.  (see the reference manual).

     <li>The ip-address octets of any active interface, in the form (<code>ipv4_192_0_0_1</code>,
<code>ipv4_192_0_0</code>,<code>ipv4_192_0</code>,<code>ipv4_192</code>).

   </ul>

   <p>A compound class is a sequence of simple classes connected by dots or
`pipe' symbols (vertical bars).  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     myclass.sun4.Monday::
     
     sun4|ultrix|osf::
     
     </pre>

<p>A compound class evaluates to `true' if all of the individual classes
are separately true, thus in the above example the actions which follow
<code>compound_class::</code> are only carried out if the host concerned is in
<code>myclass</code>, is of type <code>sun4</code> and the day is Monday! 
In the second example, the host parsing the file must be either of
type <code>sun4</code> <em>or</em> <code>ultrix</code> <em>or</em> <code>osf</code>. 
In other words, compound classes support two operators: AND and OR,
written <code>.</code> and <code>|</code> respectively. Cfengine doesn't
care how many of these operators you use (since it skips over blank
class names), so you could write either

<pre class="smallexample">     
     solaris|irix::
     
     </pre>

<p>or

<pre class="smallexample">     
     solaris||irix::
     
     </pre>

<p>depending on your taste. On the other hand, the order in which cfengine
evaluates AND and OR operations <em>does</em> matter, and the rule
is that AND takes priority over OR, so that <code>.</code> binds classes
together tightly and all AND operations are evaluated before ORing
the final results together. This is the usual behaviour in programming
languages. You can use round parentheses in cfengine classes to
override these preferences.

   <p>Cfengine allows you to define switch on and off dummy classes so that
you can use them to select certain subsets of action.  In particular,
note that by defining your own classes, using them to make compound
rules of this type, and then switching them on and off, you can also
switch on and off the corresponding actions in a controlled way.  The
command line options <code>-D</code> and <code>-N</code> can be used for this
purpose.  See also <code>addclasses</code> in the Reference manual.

   <p>A logical NOT operator has been added to allow you to exclude
certain specific hosts in a more flexible way. The logical NOT
operator is (as in C and C++) <code>!</code>. For instance, the
following example would allow all hosts except for <code>myhost</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">        <var>action</var>:
     
         !myhost::
     
             <var>command</var>
     </pre>

<p>and similarly, so allow all hosts in a user-defined group <code>mygroup</code>,
<em>except</em> for <code>myhost</code>, you would write

<pre class="smallexample">        <var>action</var>:
     
         mygroup.!myhost::
     
             <var>command</var>
     </pre>

<p>which reads `mygroup AND NOT myhost'. The NOT operator can also be
combined with OR. For instance

<pre class="smallexample">     
        <var>class1</var>|!<var>class2</var>
     </pre>

<p>would select hosts which were either in class 1, or those
which were not in class 2.

   <p>Finally, there is a number of reserved classes.  The following are hard
classes for various operating system architectures.  They do not need to
be defined because each host knows what operating system it is running. 
Thus the appropriate one of these will always be defined on each host. 
Similarly the day of the week is clearly not open to definition, unless
you are running cfengine from outer space.  The reserved classes are:

<pre class="smallexample">     ultrix, sun4, sun3, hpux, hpux10, aix, solaris, osf, irix4, irix, irix64
        sco, freebsd, netbsd, openbsd, bsd4_3, newsos, solarisx86, aos,
               nextstep, bsdos, linux, debian, cray, unix_sv, GnU, NT
     </pre>

<p>If these classes are not sufficient to distinguish the hosts on
your network, cfengine provides more specific classes which
contain the name and release of the operating system. To find out
what these look like for your systems you can run cfengine in
`parse-only-verbose' mode:

<pre class="smallexample">     
       cfagent -p -v
     
     </pre>

<p>and these will be displayed. For example, solaris 2.4 systems
generate the additional classes <code>sunos_5_4</code> and <code>sunos_sun4m</code>,
<code>sunos_sun4m_5_4</code>.

   <p>Cfengine uses both the unqualified and fully host names as classes. Some
sites and operating systems use fully qualified names for their
hosts. i.e. <code>uname -n</code> returns to full domain qualified
hostname. This spoils the class matching algorithms for cfengine, so
cfengine automatically truncates names which contain a dot `.'  at the
first `.' it encounters. If your hostnames contain dots (which do not
refer to a domain name, then cfengine will be confused. The moral is:
don't have dots in your host names! <em>NOTE: in order to ensure that
the fully qualified name of the host becomes a class you must define the
domain variable.</em> The dots in this string will be replaced by underscores.

   <p>In summary, the operator ordering in cfengine classes is as follows:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>()</code>
     <dd>Parentheses override everything.

     <br><dt><code>!</code>
     <dd>The NOT operator binds tightest.

     <br><dt><code>.</code>
     <dd>The AND operator binds more tightly than OR.

     <br><dt><code>|</code>
     <dd>OR is the weakest operator.

<h3 class="section">Variable substitution</h3>

   <p>When you are building up a configuration file it is very useful to be
able to use variables.  If you can define your configuration in terms of
some key variables, it can be changed more easily later, it is more
transparent to the reader of the program and you can also choose to
define the variables differently on different types of system.  Another
way of saying this is that cfengine variables also belong to classes. 
Cfengine makes use of variables in three ways.

     <ul>
<li>Environment variables from the shell
<li>Special variables used in cfengine features
<li>General macro-string substitution. 
</ul>

<p>Environment variables are fetched directly from the shell on whatever
system is running the program.  An example of a special variable is the
<code>domain</code> variable from the previous section.  Straightforward macro
substitution allows you to define a symbol name to be replaced by an
arbitrary text string.  All these definitions (apart from shell
environment variables, of course) are made in the control part of the
cfengine program:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
       myvar = ( /usr/local/mydir/lib/very/long/path )   # define macro
     
     ...
     
     links:
     
       $(myvar) -&gt; /another/directory
     
     </pre>

<p>Here we define a macro called <code>myvar</code>, which is later used to
define the creation of a link.  As promised we can also define
class-dependent variables:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
       sun4:: myvar = ( sun )
       hpux:: myvar = ( HP )
     
     </pre>

   <p>Cfagent gives you access to the shell environment variables and allows
you to define variables of your own.  It also keeps a few special
variables which affect the way in which cfengine works.  When cfengine
expands a variable it looks first at the name in its list of special
variables, then in the list of user-defined macros and finally in the
shell environment for a match.  If none of these are found it expands to
the empty string. If you nest macros,
<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
       myvar = ( "$(othervar)" )
     
     </pre>
   then you must quote the right hand side
and ensure that the value
is already defined.

   <p>You can also import values from the execution of a shell command
by prefixing a command with the word <code>exec</code>. This method is deprecated
in version 2 an replaced by a function.

<pre class="smallexample">     
       control:
     
        # old method
     
        listing = ( "exec /bin/ls -l" )
     
        # new method
     
        listing = ( ExecResult(/bin/ls -l) )
     
     </pre>

<p>This sets the variable `listing' to the output of the command in the
quotes.

   <p>Some other internal functions are

     <dl>
<dt><code>RandomInt(</code><var>a</var><code>,</code><var>b</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>Generate a random integer between a and b. 
<br><dt><code>ExecResult(</code><var>command</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>Executes the named shell command and inserts the output into the variable. 
</dl>

<p>For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
      variable2 = ( RandomInt(0,23) )
     
      variable3 = ( ExecResult(/bin/ls -a /opt) )
     
     </pre>

   <p>Variables are referred to in either of two different ways, depending on
your taste.  You can use the forms <code>$(variable)</code> or
<code>${variable}</code>.  The variable in braces or parentheses can be the
name of any user defined macro, environment variable or one of the
following special internal variables.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>AllClasses</code>
     <dd>A long string in the form <code>CFALLCLASSES=class1:class2...</code>.  This
variable is a summary of all the defined classes at any given time. It
is always kept up to date so that scripts can make use of cfengine's
class data.

     <br><dt><code>arch</code>
     <dd>The current detailed architecture string--an amalgamation of the
information from <em>uname</em>. Non-definable.

     <br><dt><code>binserver</code>
     <dd>The default server for binary data.  See <a href="#NFS%20resources">NFS resources</a>. 
Non definable.

     <br><dt><code>class</code>
     <dd>The currently defined system hard-class (e.g. <code>sun4</code>, <code>hpux</code>). 
Non-definable.

     <br><dt><code>date</code>
     <dd>The current date string. Note that if you use this in a shell command it might
be interpreted as a list variable, since it contains the default separator
<code>:</code>.

     <br><dt><code>domain</code>
     <dd>The currently defined domain.

     <br><dt><code>faculty</code>
     <dd>The faculty or site as defined in control (see site).

     <br><dt><code>fqhost</code>
     <dd>The fully qualified (DNS/BIND) hostname of the system, which
includes the domain name as well.

     <br><dt><code>host</code>
     <dd>The hostname of the machine running the program.

     <br><dt><code>ipaddress</code>
     <dd>The numerical form of the internet address of the host currently running
cfengine.

     <br><dt><code>MaxCfengines</code>
     <dd>The maximum number of cfengines which should be allowed to
co-exist concurrently on the system. This can prevent excessive
load due to unintentional spamming in situations where several
cfagents are started independently. The default value is unlimited.

     <br><dt><code>ostype</code>
     <dd>A short for of <code>$(arch)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>OutputPrefix</code>
     <dd>This quoted string can be used to change the default `cfengine:'
prefix on output lines to something else. You might wish to shorten
the string, or have a different prefix for different hosts. The value
in this variable is appended with the name of the host. The default is
equivalent to,
     <pre class="smallexample">            OutputPrefix = ( "cfengine:$(host):")
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>RepChar</code>
     <dd>The character value of the string used by the file repository in
constructing unique filenames from path names. This is the character which
replaces <code>/</code> (see the reference manual).

     <br><dt><code>site</code>
     <dd>This variable is identical to <code>$(faculty)</code> and may be used interchangeably.

     <br><dt><code>split</code>
     <dd>The character on which list variables are split (see the reference manual).

     <br><dt><code>sysadm</code>
     <dd>The name or mail address of the system administrator.

     <br><dt><code>timezone</code>
     <dd>The current timezone as defined in <code>control</code>.

     <br><dt><code>UnderscoreClasses</code>
     <dd>If this is set to `on' cfengine uses hard-classes which begin with
an underscore, so as to avoid name collisions. See also Runtime Options in the
Reference manual.

     <br><dt><code>year</code>
     <dd>The current year. 
</dl>

<p>These variables are kept special because they play a special role in
setting up a system configuration.  See <a href="#Global%20configurations">Global configurations</a>. 
You are encouraged to use them to define fully
generalized rules in your programs.  Variables can be used to advantage
in defining filenames, directory names and in passing arguments to shell
commands.  The judicious use of variables can reduce many definitions to
a single one if you plan carefully.

   <p><em>NOTE: the above control variables are not case sensitive, unlike
user macros, so you should not define your own macros with these names.</em>


   <p>The following variables are also reserved and may be used to produce
troublesome special characters in strings.
     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>cr</code>
     <dd>Expands to the carriage-return character.

     <br><dt><code>dblquote</code>
     <dd>Expands to a double quote <code>"</code>

     <br><dt><code>dollar</code>
     <dd>Expands to <code>$</code>.

     <br><dt><code>lf</code>
     <dd>Expands to a line-feed character (Unix end of line).

     <br><dt><code>n</code>
     <dd>Expands to a newline character.

     <br><dt><code>quote</code>
     <dd>Expands to a single quote <code>'</code>.

     <br><dt><code>spc</code>
     <dd>Expands simply to a single space. This can be used to place spaces in
filenames etc.

     <br><dt><code>tab</code>
     <dd>Expands to a single tab character.

   </dl>

<p>You can use variables in the following places:

     <ul>
<li>In any directory name.  The <code>$(binserver)</code> variable is not always appropriate in this context.  For instance
</ul>

<pre class="smallexample">     
     links:
     
       osf::
           /$(site)/${host}/directory -&gt; somefile
     
     </pre>

     <ul>
<li>In any quoted string. (See <code>shellcommands</code> in the Reference manual). 
</ul>

<pre class="smallexample">     shellcommands:
     
       any::
     
        "/bin/echo $(timezone) | /bin/mail $(sysadm)"
        '/bin/echo "double quotes!"'
     
     </pre>

<p>The latter possibility enables cfengine's variables to be passed
on to user-defined scripts.

     <ul>
<li>To define the values of options passed to various actions,
in the form <code></code><var>option</var><code>=$(variable)</code>. 
</ul>

   <p>Variables can be defined differently under different classes by
preceding the definition with a class name.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     control:
     
        sun4::  my_macro = ( User_string_1 )
        irix::  my_macro = ( User_string_2 )
     
     </pre>

<p>Here the value assigned to <code>$(my_macro)</code> depends on which of the
classes evaluates to true.  This feature can be used to good effect to
define the mail address of a suitable system administrator for different
groups of host.
<pre class="smallexample">     control:
     
      physics::   sysadm = ( mark,fred )
      chemistry:: sysadm = ( localsys@domain )
     
     </pre>

<p>Note, incidentally, that the <code>-a</code> option
can be used to print out the mail address of the system administrator
for any wrapper scripts.

   <p>Note that macro-variables which are undefined are not expanded as of version
1.6 of cfengine. In earlier versions, undefined variables would be replaced
by an empty string, as in Perl. In versions 1.6.x and later, the variable string
remains un-substituted, if the varaiable does not exist. For instance,
<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
       actionsequence = ( shellcommands )
     
       myvar = ( "test string " )
     
     shellcommands:
     
      "/bin/echo $(myvar) $(myvar2)"
     
     </pre>
   results in:

     cfengine:host: Finished script /bin/echo test string  $(myvar2)

   <p>This allows variables to be defined on-the-fly by modules.

<h3 class="section">Defining classes and making exceptions</h3>

   <p>Cfengine communicates with itself by passing messages in the form of
classes. When a class becomes switched on or off, cfengine's
program effectively becomes modified. There are several ways in which
you can switch on and off classes. Learning these fully will take some
time, and only then will you harness the full power of cfengine.

     <ul>

     <li>Classes may be defined manually from the command line.

     <li>Classes may be defined locally in the actionsequence in order to
execute only some of the actions within a special category.

     <li>Classes may become defined if cfengine actually needs to carry out an action to
repair the system's configuration.

     <li>Classes may be defined by user-defined plug-in modules.

   </ul>

   <p>Because cfagent works at a very high level, doing very many things for
very few lines of code it might seem that some flexibility is lost. 
When we restrict certain actions to special classes it is occasionally
useful to be able to switch off classes temporarily so as to cancel the
special actions.

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">Command line classes</h4>

   <p>You can define classes of your own which can be switched on and off,
either on the command line or from the action sequence.  For example,
suppose we define a class <em>include</em>.  We use <code>addclasses</code> to
do this.

<pre class="smallexample">     addclasses = ( include othersymbols )
     </pre>

<p>The purpose of this
would be to allow certain `excludable actions' to be defined. 
Actions defined by

<pre class="smallexample">     
     any.include::
                    <var>actions</var>
     
     </pre>

<p>will normally be carried out, because we have defined <code>include</code> to
be true using <code>addclasses</code>.  But if cfagent is run in a restricted
mode, in which <code>include</code> is set to false, we can exclude these
actions.

   <p>So, by defining the symbol <code>include</code> to be false, you can exclude
all of the actions which have <code>include</code> as a member.  There are two
ways in which this can be done, one is to negate a class globally using

<pre class="example">     
     cfagent -N include
     </pre>

<p>This undefines the class <code>include</code> for the entire duration of the
program.

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">actionsequence classes</h4>

   <p>Another way to specify actions is to use a class to select only a subset
of all the actions defined in the actionsequence.  You do this by adding
a class name to one on the actions in action sequence by using a dot
<code>.</code> to separate the words.  In this case the symbol only evaluates
to `true' for the duration of the action to which it attached.  Here
is an example:
<pre class="smallexample">     
       links.onlysome
       shellcommands.othersymbols.onlysome
     
     </pre>

<p>In the first case <em></em><code>onlysome</code><em> is defined to be true</em> while
this instance of <code>links</code> is executed.  That means that only actions
labelled with the class <code>onlysome</code> will be executed as a result of
that statement.  In the latter case, both <code>onlysome</code> and
<code>othersymbols</code> are defined to be true for the duration of
<code>shellcommands</code>.

   <p>This syntax would normally be used to omit certain time-consuming
actions, such as tidying all home directories.  Or perhaps to
synchronize certain actions which have to happen in a certain order.

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">shellcommand classes</h4>

   <p>For more advanced uses of cfengine you might want to be able to
define a class on the basis of the success or failure of a user-program,
a shell command or user script. Consider the following example

<pre class="smallexample">     
     groups:
     
        have_cc = ( "/bin/test -f /usr/ucb/cc"
                    "/bin/test -f /local/gnu/cc"  )
     
     </pre>

<p>Note that as of version 1.4.0 of cfengine, you may use the word
<code>classes</code> as an alias for <code>groups</code>.  Whenever cfagent meets
an object in a class list or variable, which is surrounded by either
single, double quotes or reversed quotes, it attempts to execute the
string as a command passed to the Bourne shell. If the resulting command
has return code zero (proper exit) then the class on the left hand side
of the assignment (in this case <code>have_cc</code>) will be true. If the
command returns any other value (an error number) the result is
false. Since groups are the logical OR of their members (it is
sufficient that one of the members matches the current system), the
class <code>have_cc</code> will be defined above if either <code>/usr/ucb/cc</code>
or <code>/local/gnu/cc</code> exist, or both.

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">Feedback classes</h4>

   <p>Classes may be defined as the result of actions being carried out by
cfagent.  For example, if a file gets copied, needs to be edited or if
diskspace falls under a certain threshhold, cfagent can be made to
respond by activating classes at runtime. This allows you to create
dynamically responsive programs which react to the changing environment. 
These classes are defined as part of other statements with clauses
of the form

<pre class="example">     
       define=<var>classlist</var>
     
     </pre>

   <p>Classes like these should generally be declared at the start of a program
unless the <code>define</code> statements always precede the actions which
use the defined classes, with <code>addinstallable</code>.

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">Writing plugin modules</h4>

   <p>If the regular mechanisms for setting classes do not produce the results
you require for your configuration, you can write your own routines to
concoct the classes of your dreams. Plugin modules are added to cfagent
programs from within the actionsequence, (see Reference manual). They
allow you to write special code for answering questions which are too
complex to answer using the other mechanisms above.  This allows you to
control classes which will be switched on and the moment at which your
module attempts to evaluate the condition of the system.

   <p>Modules must lie in a special directory defined by the variable
<code>moduledirectory</code>. 
They must have a name of the form <code>module:</code><var>mymodule</var><code></code> and they
must follow a simple protocol. Cfagent will only execute a module which
is owned either by root or the user who is running cfagent, if it lies
in the special directory and has the special name.  A plug-in module may
be written in any language, it can return any output you like, but lines
which begin with a <code>+</code> sign are treated as classes to be defined
(like <code>-D</code>), while lines which begin with a <code>-</code> sign are
treated as classes to be undefined (like <code>-N</code>).  Lines starting
with <code>=</code> are variables/macros to be defined.  Any other lines of
output are cited by cfagent, so you should normally make your module
completely silent.  Here is an example module written in perl. First we
define the module in the cfagent program:

<pre class="smallexample">     
      control:
     
        moduledirectory = ( /local/cfagent/modules )
     
        actionsequence = (
                         files
                         module:myplugin.specialclass
                         "module:argplugin.specialclass arg1 arg2"
                         copy
                         )
      ...
     
     </pre>

<p>Note that the class definitions for the module can also be defined in as
<code>AddInstallables</code>, if this is more convenient. NOTE: you <em>must</em>
declare the classes before using them in the cfagent configuration, or else
those actions will be ignored. 
Next we write the plugin itself.
<pre class="smallexample">     #!/usr/bin/perl
     #
     # module:myplugin
     #
     
       # lots of computation....
     
     if (<var>special-condition</var>)
        {
        print "+specialclass";
        }
     
     </pre>

   <p>Modules inherit the environment variables from cfagent and accept arguments, just
as a regular shellcommand does.
<pre class="smallexample">     #!/bin/sh
     #
     # module:myplugin
     #
     
     /bin/echo $*
     
     </pre>
   Cfagent defines the classes as an environment variable so that programs
have access to these. E.g. try the following module:

<pre class="smallexample">     #!/usr/bin/perl
     
     print "Decoding $ENV{CFALLCLASSES}\n";
     
     @allclasses = split (":","$ENV{CFALLCLASSES}");
     
     while ($c=shift(@allclasses))
       {
       $classes{$c} = 1;
       print "$c is set\n";
       }
     
     </pre>

   <p>Modules can define macros in cfagent by outputting strings of the form
<pre class="smallexample">     
     =<var>variablename</var>=<var>value</var>
     
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">The generic class <code>any</code></h3>

   <p>The generic wildcard <code>any</code> may be used to stand for any class. 
Thus instead of assigning actions for the class <code>sun4</code> only you
might define actions for any architecture by specifying:
<pre class="smallexample">     
       any::
             <var>actions</var>
     
     </pre>

   <p>If you don't specify any class at all then cfengine assumes a default
value of <code>any</code> for the class.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Debugging tips</h3>

   <p>A useful trick when debugging is to eliminate unwanted actions by
changing their class name.  Since cfengine assumes that any class it
does not understand is the name of some host, it will simply ignore
entries it does not recognize.  For example:

<pre class="smallexample">        myclass::
     </pre>

<p>can be changed to

<pre class="smallexample">        Xmyclass::
     </pre>

<p>Since <code>Xmyclass</code> no longer matches any defined classes, and is not
the name of any host it will simply be ignored.  The <code>-N</code> option
can also be used to the same effect.  (see Reference manual).

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Access control</h3>

   <p>It is sometimes convenient to be able to restrict the access of a
program to a handful of users.  This can be done by adding an access
list to the <code>control:</code> section of your program.  For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     control:
         ...
         access = ( mark root )
     
     </pre>

<p>would cause cfengine to refuse to run the program for any other users
except mark and root.  Such a restriction would be useful, for instance,
if you intended to make set-user-id scripts but only wished certain
users to be able to run them.  If the access list is absent, all users
can execute the program.

   <p>Note: if you are running cfagent via the <code>cfrun</code> program
then cfagent is always started with the same user identity as
the cfservd process on the remote host. 
Normally this is the root user identity. This means that
the access keyword will have no effect on the use of
the command <code>cfrun</code>.

</div>

<h3 class="section">Wildcards in directory names</h3>

   <p>In the two actions <code>files</code> and <code>tidy</code> you define directory
names at which file checking or tidying searches should start.  One
economical feature is that you can define a whole group of directories
at which identical searches should start in one fell swoop by making use
of <em>wildcards</em>.  For example, the directory names

<pre class="smallexample">          /usr/*/*
          /bla/*/ab?/bla
     </pre>

<p>represent all of the <em>directories</em> (and only directories) which
match the above wildcard strings.  Cfagent opens each matching
directory and iterates the action over all directories which match.

   <p>The symbol <code>?</code> matches any single character, whereas <code>*</code>
matches any number of characters, in accordance with shell
file-substitution wildcards.

   <p>When this notation is used in directory names, it always defines the
starting point for a search.  It does not tell the command how to
search, only where to begin.  The <code>pattern</code> directive in
<code>tidy</code> can be used to specify patterns when tidying files and under
<code>files</code> all files are considered, (see Reference manual),

<h3 class="section">Recursive file sweeps/directory traversals</h3>

   <p>File sweeps are searches through a directory tree in which many files
are examined and considered for processing in some way.  There are many
instances where one uses cfagent to perform a file sweep.

     <ul>

     <li>As part of a <code>files</code> action, for checking access rights and ownership
of files.

     <li>As part of a <code>tidy</code> action, for checking files for deletion.

     <li>As part of a <code>copy</code> action, while recursively checking whether to
copy a file tree.

     <li>As part of an <code>editfiles</code> action, while recursively checking whether to
edit the files in a tree of files.

   </ul>

<p>The problem with file sweeps is that they can be too sweeping! Often you
are not interested in examining every single file in a file tree. You might
wish to perform a search

     <ul>

     <li>excluding certain named directories and their subdirectories with <code>ignore</code>.

     <li>excluding certain files and directories matching a specific pattern.

     <li>including only a subset of files matching specific patterns.

     <li>filter out very specific file types. 
</ul>

<p>The tidy action is slightly different in this respect, since it already
always expects to match a specific pattern. One is generally not
interested in a search which deletes everything except for a named
pattern: this would be too dangerous. For this reason, the syntax of
<code>tidy</code> does not allow ignore,include and exclude.  It is documented
in the section on tidying, (see Reference manual).

   <p>Items declared under the global <code>ignore</code> section affect files,
copy, links and tidy.  For file sweeps within files, copy and links, you
may provide private ignore lists using <code>ignore=</code>. The difference between
exclude and ignore is that ignore can deal with absolute directories. It prunes
directories, while exclude only looks at the files within directories.

   <p>For file sweeps within  <code>files</code> and  <code>copy</code> you can specify
specific search parameters using the keywords <code>include=</code>
and <code>exclude=</code> and as of version 1.6.x <code>filter=</code>. 
For example,
<pre class="smallexample">     files:
     
        /usr/local/bin m=0755 exclude=*.ps action=fixall
     
     </pre>

<p>In this example cfagent searches the entire file tree (omitting
any directories listed in the ignore-list and omitting
any files ending in the extension <code>.ps</code>), (see Reference manual).

   <p>Specifying the  <code>include=</code> keyword is slightly different since it
automatically restricts the search to only named patterns (using <code>*</code>
and <code>?</code> wildcards), whenever
you have one or more instances of it. If you include patterns in this
way, cfagent ignores any files which do not match the given patterns. 
It also ignores any patterns which you have specified in the global
ignore-list as well as patterns excluded with   <code>exclude=</code><var>pattern</var><code></code>. 
In other words, exclusions always override inclusions.

   <p>If you exclude a pattern or a directory and wish to treat it in
some special way, you need to code an explicit check for that pattern
as a separate entity. For example, to handle the exluded  <code>.ps</code>
files above, you would need to code something like this:
<pre class="smallexample">     files:
     
        /usr/local/bin m=0644 include=*.ps action=fixall
     
     </pre>

   <p>Note: don't be tempted to enclose your wildcards in quotes. The quotes
will be treated literally and the pattern might not match the way you
would expect.

   <p>For <code>editfiles</code> the syntax is somewhat different. Here one needs to add
lines to the edit stanza:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     editfiles:
     
      { /tmp/testdir
     
      Include .*
      Exclude bla.*
      Ignore "."
      Ignore ".."
      Recurse 6
     
      ReplaceAll "search" With "replace"
      }
     
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">Security in Recursive file sweeps</h3>

   <p>Recursively descending into directories and performing a globally `destructive'
change is an inherently risky thing to do, unless you are certain of the
directory structure.

   <p>Suppose, for instance, that a user with write access to the filesystem
added a symbolic link to <code>/etc/passwd</code>, and we were doing a
recursive deletion. Suddlenly, cfengine becomes a destructive
weapon. The default behaviour is that cfengine does not follow symbolic
links in recursive descents, for this reason. The option
<code>travlinks</code> can be set to true, in order to change this.  However,
in general, you should never change this option, especially if untrusted
users have access to parts of the filesystem, e.g. if you clear <code>/tmp</code>
recursively.

   <p>Cfagent checks for link race attacks, in which users try to swap a
directory for a link, in between system calls, to trick cfagent into
believing that a link is a directory, as of version 2.0.3 (and 1.6.4).

   <p>Note that, even if <code>travlinks</code> is set to true, cfagent will not
follow symbolic links that are not owned by the agent user ID; this is
to minimize the possibilty of link race attacks, in which users with
write access could divert the agent to another part of the filesystem.

<h3 class="section">Log files written by cfagent</h3>

   <p>Cfagent keeps two kinds of log-file privately and it allows you to log
its activity to syslog.  Syslog logging may be switched on with the
<code>Syslog</code> variable, (see Reference manual).

   <p>The first log cfagent keeps is for every user
(every subdirectory of a home directory filesystem).  A file
<code>~/.cfengine.rm</code> keeps a list of all the files which were deleted
during the last pass of the <code>tidy</code> function.  This is useful for
users who want to know files have been removed without their blessing. 
This helps to identify what is happening on the system in case of
accidents.

   <p>Another file is built when cfagent searches through file trees in the
<code>files</code> action.  This is a list of all programs which are setuid
root, or setgid root.  Since such files are a potential security risk,
cfagent always prints a warning when it encounters a new one (one which
is not already in its list).  This allows the system administrator to
keep a watchful eye over new programs which appear and give users root
access.  The cfengine log is called <code>/var/cfengine/cfengine.log</code>.  The file
is not readable for general users.

<h3 class="section">Quoted strings</h3>

   <p>In several cfengine commands, you use quoted strings to define a quantity
of text which may contain spaces. For example

<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
       macro = ( "mycommand" )
     
     editfiles:
     
       { $(HOME)/myfile
     
        AppendIfNoSuchLine 'This text contains space'
       }
     
     </pre>

<p>In each case you may use any one of the three types of quote marks in
order to delimit strings,

<pre class="smallexample">     
       ' <var>or</var> " <var>or</var> `
     
     </pre>

   <p>If you choose, say <code>"</code>, then you may not use this symbol within the
string itself. The same goes for the other types of string delimiters. 
Unlike the shell, cfengine treats these three delimiters in precisely
the same way. There is no difference between them. 
If you need to quote a quoted string, then you should choose a delimiter
which does not conflict with the substring.

   <p>Note that you can use special variables for certain symbols in a string
See <a href="#Variable%20substitution">Variable substitution</a>.

<h3 class="section">Regular expressions</h3>

   <p>Regular expressions can be used in cfagent in connection with
<code>editfiles</code> and <code>processes</code> to search for lines matching
certain expressions.  A regular expression is a generalized wildcard. In
cfagent wildcards, you can use the characters '*' and '?' to match any
character or number of characters.  Regular expressions are more
complicated than wildcards, but have far more flexibility.

   <p><em>NOTE: the special characters </em><code>*</code><em> and </em><code>?</code><em>
used in wildcards do not have the
same meanings as regular expressions!</em>.

   <p>Some regular expressions match only a single string. For example, every
string which contains no special characters is a regular expression
which matches only a string identical to itself. Thus the regular
expression <code>cfengine</code> would match only the string "cfengine", not
"Cfengine" or "cfengin" etc.  Other regular expressions could match more
general strings. For instance, the regular expression <code>c*</code> matches
any number of c's (including none). Thus this expression would match the
empty string, "c", "cccc", "ccccccccc", but not "cccx".

   <p>Here is a list of regular expression special characters and operators.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>\</code>
     <dd>The backslash character normally has a special purpose: either to
introduce a special command, or to tell the expression interpreter that
the next character is not to be treated as a special character. 
The backslash character stands for itself only when protected by square
brackets <code>[\]</code> or quoted with a backslash itself <code>\\</code>.

     <br><dt><code>\b</code>
     <dd>Matches word boundary operator.

     <br><dt><code>\B</code>
     <dd>Match within a word (operator).

     <br><dt><code>\&lt;</code>
     <dd>Match beginning of word.

     <br><dt><code>\&gt;</code>
     <dd>Match end of word.

     <br><dt><code>\w</code>
     <dd>Match a character which can be part of a word.

     <br><dt><code>\W</code>
     <dd>Match a character which cannot be part of a word.

     <br><dt><code></code><var>any character</var><code></code>
     <dd>Matches itself.

     <br><dt><code>.</code>
     <dd>Matches any character

     <br><dt><code>*</code>
     <dd>Match zero or more instances of the previous object. e.g. <code>c*</code>. 
If no object precedes it, it represents a literal asterisk.

     <br><dt><code>+</code>
     <dd>Match one or more instances of the preceding object.

     <br><dt><code>?</code>
     <dd>Match zero or one instance of the preceding object.

     <br><dt><code>{ }</code>
     <dd>Number of matches operator. <code>{5}</code> would  match exactly 5
instances of the previous object. <code>{6,}</code> would match at least
6 instances of the previous object. <code>{7,12}</code> would match at least
7 instances of, but no more than 12 instances of the preceding object. 
Clearly the first number must be less than the second to make a valid
search expression.

     <br><dt><code>|</code>
     <dd>The logical OR operator, OR's any two regular expressions.

     <br><dt><code>[</code><var>list</var><code>]</code>
     <dd>Defines a list of characters which are to be considered as a single
object (ORed). e.g. <code>[a-z]</code> matches any character in the range a to
z, <code>abcd</code> matches either a, b, c or d.  Most characters are
ordinary inside a list, but there are some exceptions: <code>]</code> ends the
list unless it is the first item, <code>\</code> quotes the next character,
<code>[:</code> and <code>:]</code> define a character class operator (see below),
and <code>-</code> represents a range of characters unless it is the first
or last character in the list.

     <br><dt><code>[^</code><var>list</var><code>]</code>
     <dd>Defines a list of characters which are NOT to be matched. i.e. 
match any character except those in the list.

     <br><dt><code>[:</code><var>class</var><code>:]</code>
     <dd>Defines a class of characters, using the ctype-library.
          <dl>

          <br><dt><code>alnum</code>
          <dd>  Alpha numeric character

          <br><dt><code>alpha</code>
          <dd>  An alphabetic character

          <br><dt><code>blank</code>
          <dd>  A space or a TAB

          <br><dt><code>cntrl</code>
          <dd>  A control character.

          <br><dt><code>digit</code>
          <dd>  0-9

          <br><dt><code>graph</code>
          <dd>  same as print, without space

          <br><dt><code>lower</code>
          <dd>  a lower case letter

          <br><dt><code>print</code>
          <dd>  printable characters (non control characters)

          <br><dt><code>punct</code>
          <dd>  neither control nor alphanumeric symbols

          <br><dt><code>space</code>
          <dd>  space, carriage return, line-feed, vertical tab and form-feed.

          <br><dt><code>upper</code>
          <dd>  upper case letter

          <br><dt><code>xdigit</code>
          <dd>  a hexadecimal digit 0-9, a-f

     </dl>

     <br><dt><code>( )</code>
     <dd>Groups together any number of operators.

     <br><dt><code>\</code><var>digit</var><code></code>
     <dd>Back-reference operator (refer to the GNU regex documentation).

     <br><dt><code>^</code>
     <dd>Match start of a line.

     <br><dt><code>$</code>
     <dd>Match the end of a line.

   </dl>

<p>Here is a few examples. Remember that some commands look for
a regular expression match of part of a string, while others
require a match of the entire string (see Reference manual).

<pre class="smallexample">     
     ^#        match string beginning with the # symbol
     ^[^#]      match string not beginning with the # symbol
     ^[A-Z].+  match a string beginning with an uppercase letter
               followed by at least one other character
     
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">Iterating over lists</h3>

   <p>Shell list variables are normally defined by joining together a list of
directories using a concatenation character such as <code>:</code>. A typical
example of this is the PATH variable:

<pre class="example">     
     PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin
     
     </pre>

   <p>It is convenient to be able to use such variables to force cfagent to
iterative over a list. This gives us a compact way of writing repeated
operations and it allows a simple method of communication with the shell
environment. For security reasons, iteration is supported only in the
following contexts:

     <ul>

     <li>in the `to' field of a multiple link action,

     <li>in the `from' field of a copy action,

     <li>in the directory field of a tidy action,

     <li>in the directory field of the files action,

     <li>in the ignore action,

     <li>in a shell command.

   </ul>

   <p>This typically allows communication with PATH-like
environment variables in the shell.

   <p>In these contexts, any variable which has the form of
a list joined together by colons will be iterated over
at compilation time. Note that you can change the value
of the list separator using the <code>split</code> variable
in the control section of the program (see Reference manual).

   <p>For example, to link all of the binary files in the PATH
environment variable to a single directory, tidying
dead links in the process, you would
write

<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
       actionsequence = ( links tidy )
     
     links:
     
       /allbin +&gt; $(PATH)
     
     tidy:
     
       # Hopefully no-match matches nothing
     
       /allbin pattern=no-match age=0 links=tidy
     
     </pre>

<p><var>no-match</var> is not a reserved word in cfengine, this is
just a string you do not expect to match any file.

   <p>Alternatively, you might want to define an internal list using
a space as a separator:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
        split = ( " " )
     
        mylist = ( "mark ricky bad-dude" )
     
     tidy:
     
        /mnt/home1/$(mylist) pattern=*.cfsaved age=1
     
     </pre>

<p>This example iterates the tidy action over the directories <code>/mnt/home1/mark</code>,
<code>/mnt/home1/ricky</code> and <code>/mnt/home1/bad-dude</code>.

   <p>The number of list variables in any path or filename should normally be
restricted to one or two, since the haphazard combination of two lists
will seldom lead to any meaningful pattern.  The only obvious exception
is perhaps to iterate over a common set of child-directories like
<code>bin</code>, <code>lib</code> etc in several different package directories.

<h3 class="section">General considerations</h3>

   <p>In order to use any system administration tool successfully, you have
to make peace with your system by deciding exactly what you expect and
what you are willing to do to achieve the results. You need to decide
what you will consider to be acceptable and what is to be considered
completely untenable. You need to make these decisions because otherwise
you will only be confused later when things don't go the way you expected.

   <p>Experience shows that the most successful policies for automation involve
keeping everything as simple as possible. The more uniform or alike your
machines are, the easier they are to run and the happier users are. 
Sometimes people claim that they need such great flexibility that all
their machines should be different. This belief tends to be inversely
proportional to the number of machines they run and generally only
applies to very special development environments!  Usually you will only
need one or to machines to be special and most can be made very similar.

   <p>Site configuration is about sharing and controlling resources.  The
resources include disks (filespace), files, data, programs, passwords
and physical machines. Before planning your sitewide configuration you
should spend some time deciding how you would like things to work.

   <p>In the remaining parts of this chapter, you will find some hints
and tips about how to proceed, but remember that when push comes
to shove, you must make your own choices.

<h3 class="section">Using netgroups</h3>

   <p>If you use the network information service (NIS) on your local network
then you may already have defined <em>netgroups</em> consisting of lists
of hosts which belong to specific owners at your site.  If you have,
then you can use these groups within cfengine.  This means that you can
use the same groups in the <code>/etc/exports</code> file as you use to define
the mount groups and classes.

   <p>A netgroup is a list of hostnames or user names which are registered in
the network information service (NIS) database under a specific name. 
In our case we shall only be interested in lists of hostnames.

   <p>To make a netgroup you need to define a list in the file
<code>/etc/netgroup</code> on your NIS server.  If you are not the NIS
administrator, you will have to ask to have a netgroup installed.  The
form of a netgroup list of hosts is:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     mylist-name      (host1,,) (host2,,) (host3,,) (host4,,)
     
     norway-sun4-host (saga,,) (tor,,) (odin,,)
     foes-linux-hosts (borg,,)
     
     </pre>

<p>Each list item has three entries, but only the first is relevant for a
host list.  See the manual pages on netgroups for a full explanation of
the meaning of these fields.

   <p>The usefulness of netgroups is that they can be used to stand for a list
of hostnames in system files like <code>/etc/exports</code>.  This compresses
the amount of text in this file from a long list to a single name.  It
also means that if you use the same list of hosts from a netgroup inside
cfengine when defining groups and classes, you can be sure that you are
always using the same list.  In particular it means that you don't have
to update multiple copies of a list of hosts.

   <p>The netgroups can now be used in cfengine programs by using the <code>+</code>
or <code>@+</code> symbols in the <code>groups</code> section.  (see Reference manual).

<h3 class="section">Files and links</h3>

   <p>File and link management takes several forms. 
Actions are divided into three categories called
<code>files</code>, <code>tidy</code> and <code>links</code>. The first of
these is used to check the existence of, the ownership
and permissions of files. The second concerns the systematic
deletion of garbage files. The third is a link manager
which tests, makes and destroys links. The monitoring
of file access bits and ownership can be set up for
individual files and for directory trees, with controlled
recursion. Files which do not meet the specified criteria
can be `fixed' --i.e. automatically set to the correct
permissions, or can simply be brought to the attention of
the system administrator by a warning. 
The syntax of such a command is as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     files:
     
       <var>class</var>::
     
         /<var>path</var> mode=<var>mode</var> owner=<var>owner</var> group=<var>group</var>
     
              recurse=<var>no-of-levels</var> action=<var>action</var>
     
     </pre>

<p>The directory or file name is the point at which cfagent
begins looking for files. From this point the search for files
proceeds recursively into subdirectories with a maximum limit set by
the <code>recurse</code> directive, and various options for dealing with
symbolic links and device boundaries. The mode-string defines the
allowed file-mode (by analogy with <code>chmod</code>) and the owner and group
may specify lists of acceptable user-ids and group-ids. The action
taken in response to a file which does not meet acceptable criteria is
specified in the action directive. It includes warning about or
directly fixing all files, or plain files or directories only. Safe
defaults exist for these directives so that in practice they may be
treated as options.

   <p>For example,
<pre class="smallexample">     files:
     
       any::
            /usr/*/bin mode=a+rx,o-w own=root r=inf act=fixall
     
     </pre>

<p>which (in abbreviated form) would check recursively all files and
directories starting from directories matching the wildcard
(e.g. <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, <code>/usr/ucb/bin</code>).  By default, <code>fixall</code>
causes the permissions and ownership of the files to be fixed without
further warning.

   <p>One problem with symbolic links is that the files they point to can
get deleted leaving a `hanging pointer'. Since cfagent can make
many hundreds of links without any effort, there is the danger that, in time,
the system could become full of links which don't point anywhere. To
combat this problem, you can set the option <code>links=tidy</code> in the files
section. If this is set, cfagent will remove any symbolic links which
do not point to existing files (see Reference manual).

   <p>The creation of symbolic links is illustrated in figure 1 and
the checking algorithm was discussed in section 2. In addition to
the creation of single links, one may also specify the creation of
multiple links with a single command. The command

<pre class="smallexample">     links:
     
        binaryhost::
     
           /local/elm/bin +&gt; /local/bin
     
     </pre>

<p>links all of the files in <code>/local/elm/bin</code> to corresponding files
in <code>/local/bin</code>. This provides, amongst other things, one simple
way of installing software packages in regular `bin' directories without
controlling users' PATH variable. A further facility makes use of
cfagent's knowledge of available (mounted) binary resources to search
for matches to specific links. Readers are referred to the full
documentation concerning this feature.

   <p>The need to tidy junk files has become increasingly evident during the
history of cfengine. Files build up quickly in areas like <code>/tmp</code>,
<code>/var/tmp</code>. Many users use these areas for receiving large
ftp-files so that their disk usage will not be noticed!  To give
another example, just in the last few months the arrival of
netscape World Wide Web client, with its caching
facilities, has flooded hard-disks at Oslo with hundreds of megabytes of
WWW files. In addition the regular appearance of <code>core</code> files<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
and compilation by-products (<code>.o</code> files and <code>.log</code> files
etc.) fills disks with large files which many users do not understand. 
The problem is easily remedied by a few lines in the cfagent
configuration. Files can be deleted if they have not been accessed for
n-days. Recursive searches are both possible and highly practical
here. In following example:

<pre class="smallexample">     tidy:
     
        AllHomeServers::
     
           home                 pattern=core       r=inf age=0
           home/.wastebasket    pattern=*          r=inf age=14
           home/.netscape-cache pattern=cache????* r=inf age=2
           home/.MCOM-cache     pattern=cache????* r=inf age=2
           home/.netscape       pattern=cache????*  r=inf age=2
     
     </pre>

<p>all hosts in the group <code>AllHomeServers</code> are instructed to
iterate over all users' home directories (using the wildcard
<code>home</code>) and look for files matching special patterns. 
Cfagent tests the <em>access time</em> of files and deletes
only files older than the specified limits. Hence all core
files, in this example, are deleted immediately, whereas files in the
subdirectory <code>.wastebasket</code> are deleted
only after they have lain there untouched for 14 days, and so on.

   <p>As a system administrator you should, of course, exercise great caution
when making rules which can delete users' files.  A single slip of the
hand can result in a rule which will irretrievably delete files.

   <p>When making a `tidy' strategy you should probably coordinate with your
backup policy.  You should not delete files until after you have taken a
backup, so that -- if the worst should happen -- you are covered
against possible accidents.

   <p>Cfagent helps to some extent to keep track of what files it deletes. 
When tidying users' home directories it creates a log file of all files
which were deleted on the last tidy operation.  This log is called
<code>~/.cfengine.rm</code>.

   <p>You might consider tidying certain files only once a week, in which case
a command such as

<pre class="smallexample">     
     tidy:
     
        AllHomeServers.Sunday::
     
            <var>files to tidy</var>
     
     </pre>

<p>could be useful.  Nonsense files, such as `core' files could be tidied every night.

   <p><em>NOTE! Be careful when telling cfagent to delete core files.  If
you write a wildcard like </em><code>core*</code><em>, then you could risk deleting
important system files such as </em><code>core.h</code><em>.</em>

<h3 class="section">Copying files</h3>

   <p>The administration of a system often requires the copying of files. The
reason for this is usually that we would like to distribute a copy of a
particular file, from some master location and ensure that all of the
copies are up to date. Another use for this is to install software from
one directory (perhaps on a CD ROM) to another.

   <p>Cfagent helps this process by allowing you to copy a single file or a
file tree, from one directory to another, perhaps checking the
permissions and owners of a file to adjust the copies in some special
way. The files are checked by cfagent using one of two methods.

     <ul>

     <li>A date-stamp comparison with a master file, using last-change times, can
be used to tell cfagent to recopy a file from the master if the master
file is newer than the copy.

     <li>A checksum can be computed for each file and compared with one for
the master file. If the contents of the copy file differs in any way from
the master, the file will be re-copied.

   </ul>

<p>Cfengine allows you to do the following

     <ul>

     <li>Copy a single file to another file in a different location, perhaps with a
new name, new permissions and a different owner.

     <li>Copy a single file to all users on the system, changing the owner of the
file for each user automatically. (This could be used to distribute and
update standard setup files.)

     <li>Recursively copy an entire file tree, omitting files which match a list
of wildcard-patterns, or linking certain files instead of copying.

   </ul>

<p>You can find out more about copying in the reference section.

<h3 class="section">Managing processes</h3>

   <p>Cfagent allows you to check for the existence of processes on your

configuration files, or killing unwanted processes (such as user
programs which hog the system at peak usage times).

<h3 class="section">Cfengine's model for NFS-mounted filesystems</h3>

   <p>Most of the filesystems that you will want to make available across the
network are going to fall into one of two categories.  In cfengine
parlance these are called <em>home directories</em> and <em>binary
directories</em>.  A home directory is a place where users' login
directories are kept.  This is traditionally a directory called
<code>/home</code> or <code>/users</code> or some subdirectory of these.  A binary
directory is a place where compiled software is kept.  Such files (which
do not belong to the pure operating system release) are often placed in
a directory called <code>/usr/local</code> or simply <code>/local</code>.

   <p>In this chapter we shall consider a scheme for using cfengine to make NFS filesystem management
quite painless.

<h4 class="subsection">NFS filesystem resources</h4>

   <p>Using the Network File System (NFS) in a large workstation environment
requires a bit of planning.  The idea of NFS is to share files on one
host with other hosts.  In most cases, filesystems to be shared across
the network fall into two categories: <em>binary</em> filesystems (those
which contain compiled software) and <em>user</em> or <em>home</em>
filesystems (which contain users' login areas).

   <p>The most simple minded way to share resources would be to mount every
resource (each available NFS filesystem) onto every host.  To avoid
collisions, each filesystem would have to have a unique name.  This is
one possibility, but not a very intelligent one.  As experienced users
will realize, cross-mounting too many NFS filesystems is a recipe for
all kinds of trouble.

   <p>Cfengine offers a simple model which can help you pick out only the
resources you need from the list of NFS filesystems.  It will then mount
them automatically and edit the appropriate filesystem tables.  It does
this by defining classes of hosts.  For instance -- you really don't
need to mount a binary filesystem for an <code>ultrix</code> system onto an
<code>HPUX</code> system.  There would be no point -- binary resources are
<em>architecture</em> or <em>hard-class dependent</em>.  But home directories
are architecture independent.

   <p>Cfengine lets you to define a list of allowed servers for various hosts
so that only filesystems from the servers will be considered for mounting!

<h4 class="subsection">Unique filesystem mountpoints</h4>

   <p>The first step towards treating NFS filesystems as network resources is
to invent a naming scheme so that every filesystem has a unique name on
which it can be mounted.  If we don't sort this out now, we could find
two or more hosts with a filesystem called <code>/usr/local</code>, both of
which we might like to mount since they contain different software.

   <p>A simple but extremely useful naming scheme is the following. 
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>  If you don't like this
scheme you can invent your own, but the remainder of the text will
encourage you to use this one.  If you follow this scheme, exactly
as described here, you will never have any problems with mount points. 
We shall describe the scheme in detail below. Here are some points
to digest:

     <ul>

     <li>When mounting a remote filesystem on your local system, the local and
remote directories should always have exactly the same name.

     <li>The name of every filesystem mountpoint should be unique and tell
you something meaningful about where it is located and
what its function is.

     <li>You can always make links from special unique names to more general
names like <code>/usr/local</code>. If you this involves compiled software and
you do this on one host, you should do it on others which are of the
same type.

     <li>It doesn't matter whether software compiles in the path names
of special directories into software as long as you follow
the points above.

   </ul>

<p>Each filesystem is given a directory
name composed of three parts:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     /site/host/contents
     
     </pre>

<p>The first directory (which only exists to create a suitable mountpoint)
is the name of your local site.  If you are a physics department at a
university (with a separate setup) you could call this `physics'.  It
could be your company name or whatever.  The second piece is the name of
the host to which the disk space is physically attached.  The final
piece is the name of the filesystem.  Here are some typical examples:

<pre class="smallexample">     /physics/einstein/local    # /usr/local for einstein@physics
     /physics/newton/u1         # user partition 1 for newton@physics
     </pre>

<p>On the machines which are home to the `local' partition, it is better to
make a link to <code>/usr/local</code> than call the filesystem
<code>/usr/local</code> directly.  This is because it makes the procedure of
organizing the entire network much clearer.

   <p>It is worth noting that, when you ask cfagent to mount such a resource,
it will automatically make the mount directory and can easily be asked
to make a link to <code>/usr/local</code>, so this small amount of extra work
is really no work at all.

   <p>The whole naming convention is compactly summarized by defining a mount
point variable, <code>mountpattern</code>.  With the present scheme, this can
be defined as

<pre class="smallexample">     mountpattern = ( /$(site)/$(host) )
     </pre>

<p>so that it evaluates to the name of the host executing the file
regardless of who that may be.  This variable is used together with the
<code>homepattern</code> pattern variable, which is used to distinguish
between home directories and binary resources. (See <code>homepattern</code>
in the reference section).  You can think of this as being part of the
naming convention.  In this text, we use the convention <code>u1 u2
u3...</code> for home disks.  You could equally well use <code>home1 home2...</code>
etc.  As long as the name is unique, it doesn't matter.

   <p>The full list of named resources should now be listed in the
<code>mountables</code> list, which is simply a list of all the resources
available for mounting on the network.

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">How does it work?</h4>

   <p>Once you have defined your unique names, how does cfagent know what to
mount? The idea is now to define a list of servers for each class of
hosts.

   <p>Suppose we make a <code>binserver</code> declaration:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     binservers:
     
       mygroup.sun4::
     
          einstein
          newton
     
     </pre>

<p>This would tell cfagent that it should mount all binary resources from
hosts <code>einstein</code> or <code>newton</code> onto any host of type <code>sun4</code>
in the group <code>mygroup</code>.  Every filesystem which is listed in
<code>mountables</code> and is not a home directory will be mounted.

   <p>Home directories and binary resources are kept separate automatically by
cfagent, because a home directory is one whose contents-name matches
the <code>homepattern</code> pattern variable.  See <a href="#Unique%20filesystem%20mountpoints">Unique filesystem mountpoints</a>.

   <p>A <code>homeserver</code> declaration:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     homeservers:
     
       mygroup::
     
          einstein
          newton
          schwinger
          feynman
     
     </pre>

<p>would correspondingly mean mount all the home directory resources on the
hosts in the list on all hosts in the group <code>mygroup</code>.  Clearly it
is unnecessary to distinguish between the architecture platform types of
the actual servers for user directories.

   <p>In each case, cfagent will mount filesystems, make the appropriate
directories for the mount point and edit the filesystem table.

Up:<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#NFS%20resources">NFS resources</a>
<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">Special variables</h4>

   <p>Once you have mounted a resource on a unique directory, you have access
to all of the relevant filesystems on your network -- but you really
wanted the `local' filesystem to be mounted on <code>/usr/local</code>.  All
you need do now is to make a link:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     links:
     
       any::
     
           /usr/local  -&gt; /$(site)/$(binserver)/local
     
     </pre>

<p>The meaning of this is that, on any host, the directory
<code>/usr/local</code> should be a link to the `nearest' binary server's
`local' resource.  The <code>$(binserver)</code> variable can in principle
expand to any binary server in the list.  In practice, cfagent goes
through the list in order and picks the first filesystem resource which
matches.

   <p>Could this lead to a collision? Suppose we are on the host `einstein'
and we execute the above command.  The host `einstein' has a filesystem
<code>/physics/einstein/local</code> on its local disk -- it is in fact the
binary server for the network, so it certainly doesn't need to mount any
NFS filesystems.  But this is no problem because cfagent automatically
treats <code>$(host)</code> as the highest priority binary server for any
host.  That means that if you have a local filesystem, it will always
have priority.

   <p>In contrast, if the host `schwinger' ran the command above, it would
find no local filesystem called <code>/physics/schwinger/local</code>, so it
would go along the list of defined binary servers, find `einstein' and
try again.  It will succeed in finding `einstein' <em>provided all the
binary servers were mounted before the link command is executed</em>.  This
means that you should structure the <code>actionsequence</code> so that all
filesystems are mounted before any links are made.

   <p>With a little practice, the cfengine model can lead to an enormous
simplification of the issue of NFS-mountable resources.

   <p>NOTE: cfengine does not try to export filesystems, only mount already
exported filesystems.  If you want to automate this procedure also, you
can use the <code>editfiles</code> facility to add entries to
<code>/etc/exports</code> (see <code>editfiles</code> in the Reference manual).  In practice this is very
difficult to do and perhaps not desirable.

<h4 class="subsection">Example programs for mounting resources</h4>

   <p>Let's write a very simple configuration for a network with only one
server called hal, where all the hosts are of the same operating system
type.  In such an example we can avoid using classes altogether.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
       site   = ( univ )
       domain = ( univ.edu )
     
       actionsequence =
          (
          mountall
          mountinfo
          addmounts
          mountall
          links
          )
     
     binservers:
     
        hal
     
     homeservers:
     
        hal
     
     mailserver:
     
        hal:/var/spool/mail
     
     mountables:
     
        hal:/univ/home1
        hal:/univ/home2
        hal:/univ/local
     
     links:
     
        /usr/local -&gt; /univ/local
     
     </pre>

   <p>In this example, we have only one type of host so the configuration is
the same for each of them: no class references are required.  If we look
through the action sequence we see that the program first mounts all the
filesystems which are already defined on each host.  It does this to be
sure that everything which is already set up to be mounted is mounted. 
Let's assume that there are no problems with this.

   <p>The next thing that happens is that <code>mountinfo</code> builds a list of
the filesystems which each host has successfully mounted.  Then by
calling <code>addmounts</code> we ask cfagent to check whether the host is
missing any filesystems.  What happens is that cfagent first looks to
see what servers are defined for each host.  In this case all hosts on
the network have only one server: hal.  Hal is defined as a server for
both binary data and `home' data -- i.e.  users' home directories.  The
list <code>mountables</code> tells cfagent what filesystems are available
over the network for the server hal.  There are three filesystems which
can be mounted, called <code>/univ/home1</code>, <code>/univ/home2</code> and
<code>/univ/local</code>.  Cfagent checks to see whether each of these
filesystems is mounted and, if not, it builds the necessary directories,
edits the necessary files and mounts the filesystems.

   <p>Finally we come to <code>links</code> in the action sequence.  This tells
cfagent to look at the defined links.  There is one link defined: a
link from <code>/usr/local</code> to the mounted filesystem
<code>/univ/local</code>.  Cfagent checks and tries to make the link if
necessary.  If all goes well, each host on the network should now have
at least three filesystems mounted and a link from <code>/usr/local</code> to
<code>/univ/local</code>.

   <p>Here is another simple example program for checking and automatically
mounting an NFS based <code>/usr/local</code> and all home directories onto
all hosts on a small network.  Here we have several servers and must
therefore use some classes.

<pre class="smallexample">     #
     #  Mounts
     #
     
     
     control:
     
        site      = ( mysite )
        domain    = ( mysite.country )
        sysadm    = ( mark )
        netmask   = ( 255.255.255.0 )
     
        actionsequence =
           (
           mountall
           mountinfo
           addmounts
           mountall
           links
           )
     
        mountpattern = ( /$(site)/$(host) )
        homepattern   = ( u? )                # u1 u2 u3 etc..
     
     groups:
     
        MyGroup =
           (
           host1
           host2
           binserver1
           binserver2
           )
     
     ######################################################################
     
     homeservers:
     
        MyGroup:: host1
     
     
     binservers:
     
        MyGroup.sun4::   server1
        MyGroup.ultrix:: server2
     
     mailserver:
     
        host1:/usr/spool/mail
     
     mountables:
     
        host1:/mysite/host1/u1
        host1:/mysite/host1/u2
        server1:/mysite/server1/local
        server2:/mysite/server2/local
     
     
     ##########################################################################
     
     links:
     
           /usr/local  -&gt; /${site}/${binserver}/local
     
     </pre>

   <p>Let's suppose we run this program on host2 which is an ultrix machine. 
This host belongs to the class <code>mygroup</code> and the hard-class
<code>ultrix</code>.  This tells us that its homeserver is host1, its binary
server is server2 and its mailserver is host1.  Moreover, since the
homepattern matches any filesystem ending in u-something, it recognizes
the two home directories in the mountables list -- and therefore the
two binary directories also.

   <p>The action sequence starts by mounting all of the filesystems currently
in the filesystem table <code>/etc/fstab</code>.  It then scans the list of
mounted filesystems to find out what is actually mounted.  Since the
homeserver is host1, we know that our host has to mount all
home-filesystems from this server, so it checks for
<code>host1:/mysite/host1/u1</code> and <code>host1:/mysite/host1/u2</code>.  If
they are not present they are added to <code>/etc/fstab</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.  Next, we know that the binary server is server1,
so we should check for <code>server1:/mysite/server1/local</code>.  The mail
server is also checked for and added if necessary.  Cfagent then tries
to mount all filesystems once again, so that the new filesystems should
be added.

   <p>Note that, in the process of adding the filesystems to
<code>/etc/fstab</code>, cfagent creates the directories up to and including
the point at which the filesystems should be mounted.  If something
prevents this -- if we try to mount on top of a plain file for instance
-- then this will result in an error.

   <p>Finally, we reach the link section and we try to expand the variables. 
<code>$(site)</code> expands to <code>mysite</code>.  <code>$(binserver)</code> expands
first to the hostname (host2), but <code>/mysite/host2/local</code> does not
exist, so it then goes to the binserver list, which substitutes server1
for the value of <code>$(binserver)</code>.  Since
<code>/mysite/server1/local</code> does exist and is now mounted, cfagent
makes a link to this directory from <code>/usr/local</code>.  The script is
then completed.

   <p>If the script is run again, everything should now be in place so nothing
happens.  If for some reason it failed the first time, it will fail
again.  At any rate it will either do the job once and for all or signal
an error which must be corrected by human intervention<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4"><sup>4</sup></a>.

<h3 class="section">Using the automounter</h3>

   <p>The automounter is a daemon based service which replaces static mounting
of NFS filesystems with a dynamical model. When the automounter is
running, filesystems are mounted only when a user tries to access a file
which resides on one of those filesystem. After a given period (usually
five minutes) any filesystem which has not been accessed is
unmounted. The advantage of this scenario is that hanging servers do not
affect the behaviour of hosts which mount their filesystems, unless a
specific file is being accessed.  In both cases, filesystems must be
exported in order to be mountable.

   <p>It is not the purpose of this section to explain the use of the
automounter in detail, only to offer hints as to how cfengine can be
used to simplify and rationalize automount configuration for the already
initiated.  Let us begin by comparing the behaviour of the automounter
with the cfengine model for mounted filesystems.

   <p>The automounter is designed to be used together with a global
configuration file, distributed by NIS (the network information
service). As such, all hosts read the same configuration
file. This makes it appear as though all hosts end up mounting every
filesystem in the automount configuration database, but this is not so
in practice because filesystems are only mounted if required. Thus a
system which does not require a filesystem will not attempt to mount it. 
Moreover, the existence of a global configuration file does not affect
which hosts have the right to mount certain filesystems (which is specified
by exports or share on the relevant server), thus a request to mount
a non-exported filesystem will result in an access denial. The automounter
is configured locally on each host in files named <code>/etc/auto_master</code>,
<code>auto_direct</code> etc.

   <p>In the cfengine static mounting scheme, you define a list of binary
and home servers. The filesystem table is modified on the basis of
these decisions, and filesystems are only added if cfagent deems it
appropriate to mount them on a given host. The idea here is to minimize
the number of filesystems mounted to those which are known to be required. 
Again the issue of access permissions must be arranged separately. These
filesystems are placed directly in <code>/etc/fstab</code>, or the equivalent for
your system.

   <p>From cfengine, you can use the automounter instead of the static mount model
by

     <ul>

     <li>omitting <code>addmounts</code>, <code>mountinfo</code>, <code>mountall</code>
from the actionsequence, in the control part
of your cfengine program,

     <li>using <code>editfiles</code> to edit the relevant configuration files
such as <code>/etc/auto_master</code>, or <code>auto_direct</code> etc,

     <li>using the <code>AutomountDirectResources</code> command in editfiles
to dump the list of cfengine class-based list of mountables
into a file of your choice in the correct format for
autmount's direct maps,

     <li>using <code>processes</code> to restart the automounter
(send the hangup signal <code>hup</code>), or perhaps stop and restart
the daemon by sending the <code>term</code> signal (you should never
send the <code>kill</code> signal).

     <li>using the multiple link facilities to link in indirect mounted
filesystems as required, and <code>files</code> or <code>tidy</code> to
clean up stale links afterwards,

     <li>perhaps using <code>copy</code> to distribute basic automount configuration
files to multiple systems.

   </ul>

   <p>The automounter was created to solve certain problems which cfengine now
solves (in the author's opinion) better. For example, the use of the
`hosts' map in the automounter mounts filesystems like
<code>/usr/local</code> on different (uniquely named) mountpoints for each host
in order to avoid name space collisions. Using cfengine and a unique
naming scheme, you can achieve the same thing more cleanly, without all
of the gratuitous linking and unlinking which the automounter performs
by itself. Moreover, the idea of a unique name-space is better practice
and more in keeping with new global filesystem ideas such as AFS and DFS. 
The only advantage of the automounter is that one avoids the annoying
error messages from hung servers about "NFS server not responding". 
In that respect, it seems sensible to use only direct mounts and a
unique name space.

   <p>Some systems advocate grouping all users' login (home) directories
under a common directory called <code>/home</code> or <code>users</code>. 
The automounter goes through all manner of contortions to achieve
this task. If you use a unique naming scheme like the one
advocated here, this is a trivial task. You simply arrange to mount
or automount all user directories, such as

<pre class="smallexample">        /<var>site</var>/<var>host</var>/home1
        /<var>site</var>/<var>host</var>/home2
        ...
     </pre>

<p>and then link them as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     
        /home +&gt; /<var>site</var>/<var>host</var>/home1
        /home +&gt; /<var>site</var>/<var>host</var>/home2
        ...
     
     </pre>

   <p>Finally, you should be aware that the automounter does not like
to be mixed with static mount and unmount operations. Automounted
filesystems take priority over statically mounted filesystems, but
the automounter can be confused by manually mounting or unmounting
filesystems while it is running.

<h3 class="section">Editing Files</h3>

   <p>A very convenient characteristic of BSD/System 5 systems is that they
are configured primarily by human-readable textfiles. This makes it easy
for humans to configure the system and it also simplifies the automation
of the procedure.  Most configuration files are line-based text files, a
fact which explains the popularity of, for example, the Perl programming
language.  Cfengine does not attempt to compete with Perl or its
peers. Its internal editing functions operate at a higher level which
are designed for transparency rather than flexibility.  Fortunately most
editing operations involve appending a few lines to a file, commenting
out certain lines or deleting lines.

   <p>For example, some administrators consider the finger service to be
a threat to security and want to disable it. This could be done
as follows.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     editfiles:
     
           { /etc/inetd.conf
     
           HashCommentLinesContaining "finger"
           }
     
     </pre>

   <p>Commands containing the word `Comment' are used to `comment out' certain
lines from a text-file--i.e. render a line impotent without actually
deleting it. Three types of comment were supported originally: shell
style (hash) <code>#</code>, <code>%</code> as used in TeX and on AIX systems, and
C++-style <code>//</code>.

   <p>A more flexible way of commenting is also possible, using directives
which first define strings which signify the start of a comment and the
end of a comment. A single command can then be used to render a comment. 
The default values of the comment-start string is <code># </code> and the
default comment-end string is the empty string.  For instance, to define
C style comments you could write:

<pre class="smallexample">     
       { <var>file</var>
     
       SetCommentStart "/* "
       SetCommentEnd   " */"
     
       # Comment out all lines containing printf!
     
       CommentLinesMatching ".*printf.*"
       }
     
     </pre>

   <p>Other applications for these editing commands include monitoring and
controlling root-access to hosts by editing files such as <code>.rhosts</code>
and setting up standard environment variables in global shell resource
files-- for example, to set the timezone. You can use the editing
feature to update and distribute the message of the day file,
or to configure sendmail, (see FAQS and Tips in the Reference manual).

   <p>An extremely powerful feature of cfagent is the ability to
edit a similar file belonging to every user in the system. For example,
as a system administrator, you sometimes need to ensure that users
have a sensible login environment. Changes in the system might require
all users to define a new environment variable, for instance. This is
achieved with the <code>home</code> pseudo-wildcard. If one writes

<pre class="smallexample">     
       { home/.cshrc
     
       AppendIfNoSuchLine "# Sys admin/cfengine: put next line here"
       AppendIfNoSuchLine "setenv PRINTER newprinter"
       }
     
     </pre>

<p>then the users' files are checked one-by-one for the given lines of
text, and edited if necessary.

   <p>Files are loaded into cfagent and edited in memory. They are
only saved again if modifications to the file are carried out,
in which case the old file is preserved by adding a suffix
to the filename. When files are edited, cfagent generates a
warning for the administrator's inspection so that the reason
for the change can be investigated.

   <p>The behaviour of cfagent should not be confused with that of <em>sed</em>
or <em>perl</em>.  Some functionality is reproduced for convenience, but
the specific functions have been chosen on the basis of (i) their
readability and (ii) the fact that they are
`frequently-required-functions'. A typical file editing session involves
the following points:

     <ul>
<li>Load file into memory. 
<li>Is the size of the file within sensible user-definable limits? 
If not, file could be binary, refuse to edit. 
<li>Check each editing command and count the number of edits made. 
<li>If number of edits is greater than zero, rename the old file
and save the edited version in its place. Inform about the edit. 
<li>If no edits are made, do nothing, say nothing. 
</ul>

   <p>Equivalent one-line sed operations involve editing the same file
perhaps many times to achieve the same results--without the
safety checks in addition.

<h3 class="section">Disabling and the file repository</h3>

   <p>The existence of certain files can compromise the integrity of your
system and you may wish to ensure that they do not exist. For example,
some manufacturers sell their workstations with a <code>+</code> symbol in
the file <code>/etc/hosts.equiv</code>. 
This means that anyone in your NIS domain has password free access
to the system!! Since this is probably not a good idea, you will
want to disable this file by renaming it, or simply deleting it.

<pre class="smallexample">     
       disable:
     
          /etc/hosts.equiv
     
     </pre>

<p>Other files compromise the system because they grow so large that they
fill an entire disk partition. This is typically true of log files such as
the system 5 files <code>/var/adm/wtmpx</code> and
<code>/var/lp/logs/lpsched</code>. Other files like <var>/var/adm/messages</var>
get "rotated" by the system so that they do not grow so large as to
fill the disk. You can make cfagent rotate these files too, by
writing

<pre class="smallexample">     
     disable:
     
         Sunday::
     
         /var/lp/logs/lpsched  rotate=3
     
     </pre>

<p>Now, when cfagent is run, it renamed the file <code>lpsched</code> to
a file called <code>lpsched.1</code>. It also renames <code>lpsched.1</code>
as <code>lpsched.2</code> and so on, until a maximum of 3 files are
kept. After passing 3, the files `fall off the end' and
are deleted permanently. This procedure prevents any log files
from growing too large. If you are not interested in keeping
back-logs, then you may write <code>rotate=empty</code> and cfagent
will simply empty the log file.

   <p>When ever cfagent disables a file (<code>disable</code> or <code>links</code> with
the <code>!</code>  operator), or saves a new file on top of an old one
(<code>copy</code> or <code>editfiles</code>), it makes a backup of the
original. Usually disabled files are renamed by appending the string
<code>.cfdisabled</code> the filename; copied files are saved by appending
the string <code>.cfsaved</code>. 
It is possible to switch off backup file
generation in the copy feature by setting the variable
<code>backup=false</code>, but a better way of managing disabled and backed-up
files is to use a directory in which you collect all such files for the
whole system. This directory is called the file repository and is set in
the control part of the program, as follows:
In the <code>copy</code> directive, the option <code>backup=timestamp</code> can be
used to allow multiple backups. This is useful when using cfengine to make
disk backups for users, since it allows multiple versions to co-exist.

<pre class="smallexample">     
       control:
     
          repository = ( <var>directory-name</var> )
     </pre>

   <p>If this variable is defined, cfagent collects all backup and disabled files
(except for rotated files) in this directory, using a unique pathname. 
You can then inspect these files in the repository and arrange to tidy
the repository for old files which are no longer interesting.

<h3 class="section">Running user scripts</h3>

   <p>Above all, the aim of cfengine is to present a simple interface to
system administrators. The actions which are built into the engine are
aimed at solving the most pressing problems, not at solving every
problem.  In many cases administrators will still need to write
scripts to carry out more specific tasks. These scripts can still be
profitably run from cfengine. Variables and macros defined in cfengine
can be passed to scripts so that scripts can make maximal advantage of
the class based decisions. Also note that, since the days of the week
are also classes in cfengine, it is straightforward to run weekly
scripts from the cfengine environment (assuming that the configuration
program is executed daily). An obvious use for this is to update
databases, like the fast-find database one day of the week, or to run
quota checks on disks.

<pre class="smallexample">     shellcommands:
     
        myhost.Sunday::
     
           "/usr/bin/find/updatedb"
     
     </pre>

<p>Cfengine scripts can be passed variables using normal variable
substitution:

<pre class="smallexample">     control:
     
        cfbin     = ( /var/cfengine/bin )
        backupdir = ( /iu/dax/backup )
     
     shellcommands:
     
       "$(cfbin)/cfbackup -p -f $(backupdir) -s /iu/nexus/u1"
     
     </pre>

   <p>If you need to write a particularly complex script to expand cfagent's
capabilities, it might be useful to have full access to the defined
classes. You can do this in one of two ways:

     <ul>

     <li>Pass the variable <code>$(allclasses)</code> to the script. This contains a
list of all classes in the form of a string

     <pre class="smallexample">          
                CFALLCLASSES=<var>class1</var>:<var>class2</var>:...
          
          </pre>

     <p>This variable always contains an up to date list of the defined
classes.

     </p><li>Use the command line option <code>-u</code> or <code>--use-env</code>. When this
is defined, cfagent defines an internal environment variable
called <code>CFALLCLASSES</code> which contains the same list as above. 
Unfortunately, system 5 boxes don't seem to like having to update
an environment variable continuously and tend to dump core, so
this is not the default behaviour!

<h3 class="section">Compressing old log files</h3>

   <p>In the previous two sections we have looked at how to rotate old log files
and how to execute shell commands. If you keep a lot of old log files around
on your system, you might want to compress them so that they don't take up
so much space. You can do this with a shell command. The example
below looks for files matching a shell wildcard. Names of the form
<code>file.1</code>, <code>file.2</code>...<code>file.10</code> will match this wildcard
and the compression program sees that they get compressed. The output
is dumped to avoid spurious messages.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     shellcommands:
     
       "$(gnu)/gzip /var/log/*.[0-9] /var/log/*.[0-9][0-9]  &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1"
     
     </pre>

   <p>Cfagent will also recognize rotated files if they have been compressed, with
suffixes <code>.Z</code>, <code>.gz</code>, <code>.rbz</code> or <code>.rbz</code>.

<h3 class="section">Managing ACLs</h3>

   <p>Access control lists are extended file permissions. They allow you to
open or close a file to a named list of users (without having to
create a special group for those users).  They also allow you to open
or close a file for a named list of groups.  Several Unix-like
operating systems have had access control lists for some time; but they
do not seem to have caught on.

   <p>There is a number of reasons for this dawdling in the past.  The tools
for setting ACLs are generally interactive and awkward to use. 
Because a named list of users would lead to excessive verbosity in an
<kbd>ls -l</kbd> listing, one does not normally see them. There is
therefore the danger that the hidden information would lead to
undetected blunders in opening files to the wrong users.  ACLs are
also different on every vendor's filesystems and they don't work over
intersystem NFS.  In spite of these reservations, ACLs are a great
idea. Here at Oslo College, it seems that users are continually asking
how they can open a file just for the one or two persons they wish to
collaborate with. They have grown used to Novell/PC networks which
embraced the technology from Apollo/NCS much earlier. Previously the
Unix answer to users has always been: go ask the system administrator
to make a special group for you.  Then do the <code>chmod</code> thing. And
then they would say: so what's so great about this Unix then?

   <p>Addressing this lack of standardization has been the job of a POSIX
draft committee. Some vendors have made their implementations in
the image of this draft. Solaris 2.6 has a good implementation. 
In spite of this, even these systems have only
awkard tools for manipulating ACLs. Not the kind of thing you want
to be around much, if you have better things to do. 
But the incompatibility argument applies only to multiple vendor
headbutting. Some institutions who share data on a global basis opt
for advanced solutions to network filesystems, such as AFS and DFS. 
Filesystems such as DCE's DFS make extensive use of file ACLs, and
they are not operating system specific.  Even so, DFS provides only interactive
tools for examining and setting file permissions, and this is of
little use to system administrators who would rather relegate that sort
of thing to a script.

   <p>The need for this kind of thing is clear. Systems which make use of ACLs
for security can be brought to their knees by changing a few ACLs. Take
the Apollo/Domain OS as an example. All one needs to do to kill the
system is to change a few ACLs and forget what they were supposed to
be. Suddenly the system is crippled, nothing works. The only solution,
if you don't have a backup, is to remove all of the security. Unix has a
simpler security philosophy when it comes to the operating system files,
but ACLs would be a valuable addition to the security of our data.

   <p>A cfagent bare-bones file-checking program looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     #
     # Free format cfagent program
     #
     
      control:
     
        ActionSequence - ( files )
     
      files:
     
        classes::
     
          /directory/file  mode=644
                           owner=mark,ds
                           group=users,adm
                           acl=zap
                           action=fixplain
     
       # ... more below
     
     </pre>

<p>This program simply checks the permissions and ownership of the named
file. The regular file mode, owner and group are specified
straightforwardly.  The new feature here is the <code>acl</code> directive. It
is a deceptively simply looking animal, but it hides a wealth of
complexity.  The <code>zap</code> is, of course, not an access control
list.  Rather, cfagent uses a system of aliases to refer to ACLs, so
that the clutter of the complex ACL definitions does not impair the
clarity of a file command.  An ACL alias is defined in a separate part
of the program which looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">      # ...contd
     
     
      acl:
     
        { zap
     
        method:append
        fstype:solaris
        user:rmz:rwx
        user:len:r
        }
     
     </pre>

<p>As you can see, an ACL is a compound object--a bundle of information
which specifies which users have which permissions.  Because ACLs are
<em>lists</em> the alias objects must also know whether the items are to
be appended to an existing list or whether they are to replace an
existing list. Also, since the permission bits, general options and
programming interfaces are all different for each type of filesystem,
we have to tell cfagent what the filesystem type is.

   <p>It is possible to associate several ACL aliases with a file. 
When cfagent checks a files with ACLs, it reads the existing
ACL and compares it to the new one. Files are only modified if
they do not conform to the specification  in the cfengine
program. Let's look at a complete example:

<pre class="smallexample">      files:
     
        $(HOME)/myfile acl=acl_alias1 action=fixall
     
      acl:
     
        { acl_alias1
     
        method:append
        fstype:solaris
        user:len:rwx
        }
     
     </pre>

<p>ACLs are viewed in Solaris with the command <code>getfacl</code>. 
Suppose that, before running this program, our test-file had permissions

<pre class="smallexample">        user:*:rwx
        user:mark:rwx           #effective:r-x
        group:*:r-x              #effective:r-x
        mask:r-x
        other:r-x
        default_user:rw-
        default_group:r--
        default_mask:-w-
        default_other:rwx
     </pre>

<p>After the cfagent run, the ACL would become:

<pre class="smallexample">        user:*:rwx
        user:mark:rwx           #effective:r-x
        user:len:rwx            #effective:r-x
        group:*:r-x              #effective:r-x
        mask:r-x
        other:r-x
        default_user:rw-
        default_group:r--
        default_mask:-w-
        default_other:rwx
     </pre>

<p>Suppose we wanted to to remove 'w' bit for user <code>jacobs</code>, or make sure
that it was never there.

<pre class="smallexample">     	{ acl_alias1
     
     	method:append
     	fstype:solaris
     	user:jacobs:-w
     	}
     </pre>

<p>Note that the method used here is append. That means that, whatever other
access permissions we might have granted on this file, the user <code>jacobs</code>
(a known cracker) will have no write permissions on the file. Had we
used the method <code>overwrite</code> above, we would have eliminated all
other access permissions for every user and added the above. 
If we really wanted to burn <code>jacobs</code>, we could remove all rights to
the file like this

<pre class="smallexample">     
       user:jacobs:noaccess
     
     </pre>

<p>The keyword <code>noaccess</code> removes all bits. Note that this is not
necessarily the same as doing a <code>-rwx</code>, since some filesystems,
like DFS, have more bits than this. Then, if we want to forgive and forget,
the ACLs may be removed for <code>jacobs</code> with the syntax

<pre class="smallexample">       user:jacobs:default
     </pre>

   <p>In Solaris, files inherit default ACLs from the directory they
lie in; these are modified by the umask setting to generate
their own default mask.

   <p>DFS ACLs look a little different. They are examined with the
<code>acl_edit</code> command or with

<pre class="smallexample">     dcecp -c acl show &lt;filename&gt;
     </pre>

<p>In order to effect changes to the DFS, you have to perform a DCE login
to obtain authentication cookies. The user <code>cell_admin</code> is a
special user account for administrating a local DFS cell.  Suppose we
have a file with the following DCE ACL:

<pre class="smallexample">       mask_obj:r-x---
       user_obj:rwxcid
       user:cell_admin:r--c-- #effective:r-----
       group_obj:r-x--d       #effective:r-x---
       other_obj:r-x---
     </pre>

<p>Now we want to add <code>wx</code> permissions for user
<code>cell_admin</code>, and add new entries with <code>rx</code> permissons
for group <code>acct-admin</code> and user <code>root</code>.  This is done with the
following ACL alias:

<pre class="smallexample">     
        { acl_alias2
     
        method:append
        fstype:dfs
        user:/.../iu.hioslo.no/cell_admin:wx
        group:/.../iu.hioslo.no/acct-admin:rx
        user:/.../iu.hioslo.no/root:rx
        user:*:-x
        }
     
     </pre>

<p>The local cell name <code>/.../iu.hioslo.no</code> is required here. Cfagent
can not presently change ACLs in other cells remotely, but if your
cfengine program covers all of the cell servers, then this is no
limitation, since you can still centralize all your ACLs in one
place. It is just that the execution and checking takes place at
distributed locations. This is the beauty of cfengine.  After running
cfagent, with the above program snippet, the ACL then becomes:

<p>For the sake of simplicity we have only used standard Unix
bits <code>rwx</code> here, but more complicated examples may be found
in DFS. For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     
      user:mark:+rwx,-cid
     
     </pre>

<p>which sets the read, write, execute flags, but removes the
control, insert and delete flags. In the DFS, files
inherit the inital object ACL of their parent directory,
while new directories inherit the initial container object.

   <p>The objects referred to in DFS as <code>user_obj</code>, <code>group_obj</code>
and so forth refer to the owner of a file. i.e. they are equivalent
to the same commands acting on the user who owns the file concerned. 
To make the cfengine user-interface less cryptic and more in tune
with the POSIX form, we have dropped
the <code>_obj</code> suffices. A user field of <code>*</code> is a simple
abbreviation for the owner of the file.

   <p>A problem with any system of lists is that one can generate a sequence
which does one thing, and then undoes it and redoes something else,
all in the same contradictory list. To avoid this kind of accidental
interaction, cfengine insists that each user has only one ACE
(access control entry), i.e. that all the permissions for a given user
be in one entry.

<h2 class="chapter">Using cfengine as a front end for <code>cron</code></h2>

   <p>One of cfengine's strengths is its use of classes to identify systems
from a single file or set of files. Many administrators think that it
would be nice if the cron daemon also worked in this way. One possible
way of setting up cron from a global configuration would be to use the
cfengine <code>editfiles</code> facility to edit each cron file separately. A
much better way is to use cfengine's time classes to work like a user
interface for cron.  This allows you to have a single, central cfengine
file which contains all the cron jobs on your system without losing any
of the fine control which cron affords you. All of the usual advantages
apply:
     <ul>

     <li>It is easier to keep track of what cron jobs are running on the
system when you have everything in one place.

     <li>You can use all of your carefully crafted groups and user-defined
classes to identify which host should run which programs. 
</ul>

   <p>The central idea behind this scheme is to set up a regular cron
job on every system which executes cfagent at frequent intervals. 
Each time cfagent is started, it evaluates time classes and
executes the shell commands defined in its configuration file. 
In this way we use cfagent as a wrapper for the cron scripts,
so that we can use cfengine's classes to control jobs for mulitple
hosts. Cfengine's time classes are at least as powerful as <code>cron</code>'s
time specification possibilities, so this does not restrict you
in any way, See <a href="#Building%20flexible%20time%20classes">Building flexible time classes</a>. The only price
is the overhead of parsing the cfengine configuration file.

   <p>To be more concrete, imagine installing the following <code>crontab</code>
file onto every host on your network:

<pre class="smallexample">     #
     # Global Cron file
     #
     0,15,30,45 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/cfexecd -F

<h3 class="section">Structuring <code>cfagent.conf</code></h3>

<p>The structure of <code>cfagent.conf</code> needs to reflect your policy
for running jobs on the system. You need to switch on relevant tasks
and switch off unwanted tasks depending on the time of day. This can
be done in three ways:

     <ul>

     <li>By placing individual actions under classes which restrict the times at
which they are executed,

     <pre class="smallexample">          
            <var>action</var>:
          
                  Hr00.Min10_15||Hr12.Min45_55::
          
                     <var>Command</var>
          
          </pre>

     <li>By choosing a different <code>actionsequence</code> depending on the
time of day.

     <pre class="smallexample">          
            control:
          
                  Hr00::   # Action-sequence for daily run at midnight
          
                     actionsequence = ( <var>sequence</var> )
          
                 !Hr00::   # Action-sequence otherwise
          
                      actionsequence = ( <var>sequence</var> )
          
          </pre>

     <li>By importing modules based on time classes.

     <pre class="smallexample">          
            import:
          
                  Hr00:: cf.dailyjobs
          
                  any::  cf.hourlyjobs
          
          </pre>

   </ul>

<p>The last of these is the most efficient of the three, since cfengine
does not even have to spend time parsing the files for actions which
you know you will not want.

<h3 class="section">Splaying host times</h3>

   <p>The trouble with starting every cfagent at the same time using a global
cron file is that it might lead to contention or inefficiency. For
instance, if a hundred cfagents all suddenly wanted to copy a file from
a master source simultaneously this would lead to a big load on the
server. We can prevent this from happening by introducing a time delay
which is unique for each host and not longer than some given interval. 
Cfagent uses a hashing algorithm to generate a number between zero
and a maximum value in minutes which you define, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     
      # Put this in update.conf, so that the updates are also splayed
     
      control:
     
         SplayTime = ( 10 ) # minutes
     
     </pre>

<p>If this number is non-zero, cfagent goes to sleep after parsing its
configuration file and reading the clock. Every machine will go to sleep
for a different length of time, which is no longer than the time you
specify in minutes. A hashing algorithm, based on the fully qualified
name of the host, is used to compute a unique time for hosts. The
shorter the interval, the more clustered the hosts will be. The longer
the interval, the lighter the load on your servers.  This `splaying' of
the run times will lighten the load on servers, even if they come
from domains not under your control but have a similar cron policy.

   <p>Splaying can be switched off temporarily with the <code>-q</code> or <code>--no-splay</code>
options.

<h3 class="section">Building flexible time classes</h3>

   <p>Each time cfagent is run, it reads the system clock and defines the
following classes based on the time and date:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>Yr</code><var>xx</var><code>::</code>
     <dd>The current year, e.g. <code>Yr1997</code>, <code>Yr2001</code>. This class is probably
not useful very often, but it might help you to turn on the new-year lights,
or shine up your systems for the new millenium!

     <br><dt><code></code><var>Month</var><code>::</code>
     <dd>The current month can be used for defining very long term variations in
the system configuration, e.g. <code>January</code>, <code>February</code>. These
classes could be used to determine when students have their summer vacation,
for instance, in order to perform extra tidying, or to specially maintain some
administrative policy for the duration of a conference.

     <br><dt><code></code><var>Day</var><code>::</code>
     <dd>The day of the week may be used as a class, e.g. <code>Monday</code>, <code>Sunday</code>.

     <br><dt><code>Day</code><var>xx</var><code>::</code>
     <dd>A day in the month (date) may be used to single out by date, e.g. the first
day of each month defines <code>Day1</code>, the 21st <code>Day21</code> etc.

     <br><dt><code>Hr</code><var>xx</var><code>::</code>
     <dd>An hour of the day, in 24-hour clock notation: <code>Hr00</code>...<code>Hr23</code>.

     <br><dt><code>Min</code><var>xx</var><code>::</code>
     <dd>The precise minute at which cfagent was started: <code>Min0</code> ... <code>Min59</code>. 
This is probably not useful alone, but these values may be combined
to define arbitrary intervals of time.

     <br><dt><code>Min</code><var>xx</var><code>_</code><var>xx</var><code>::</code>
     <dd>The five-minute interval in the hour at which cfagent was executed, in the form
<code>Min0_5</code>, <code>Min5_10</code> .. <code>Min55_0</code>.

   </dl>

   <p>Time classes based on the precise minute at which cfagent started are
unlikely to be useful, since it is improbable that you will want to ask
cron to run cfagent every single minute of every day: there would be no
time for anything to complete before it was started again. Moreover,
many things could conspire to delay the precise time at which cfagent
were started. The real purpose in being able to detect the precise
start time is to define composite classes which refer to arbitrary
intervals of time. To do this, we use the <code>group</code> or <code>classes</code>
action to create an alias for a group of time values. 
Here are some creative examples:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     classes:  # synonym groups:
     
       LunchAndTeaBreaks = ( Hr12 Hr10 Hr15 )
     
       NightShift        = ( Hr22 Hr23 Hr00 Hr01 Hr02 Hr03 Hr04 Hr05 Hr06 )
     
       ConferenceDays    = ( Day26 Day27 Day29 Day30 )
     
       QuarterHours      = ( Min00 Min15 Min30 Min45 )
     
       TimeSlices        = ( Min01 Min02 Min03 Min33 Min34 Min35)
     
     </pre>

<p>In these examples, the left hand sides of the assignments are
effectively the ORed result of the right hand side. This if any
classes in the parentheses are defined, the left hand side class
will become defined. This provides a flexible and readable way of
specifying intervals of time within a program, without having to
use <code>|</code> and <code>.</code> operators everywhere.

<h3 class="section">Choosing a scheduling interval</h3>

   <p>How often should you call your global cron script? There are several
things to think about:

     <ul>

     <li>How much fine control do you need? Running cron jobs once each hour is
usually enough for most tasks, but you might need to exercise finer
control for a few special tasks.

     <li>Are you going to run the entire cfengine configuration file
or a special light-weight file?

     <li>System latency. How long will it take to load, parse and run the
cfengine script?

   </ul>

   <p>Cfengine has an intelligent locking and timeout policy which should be
sufficient to handle hanging shell commands from previous crons so that
no overlap can take place, See <a href="#Spamming%20and%20security">Spamming and security</a>.

<h3 class="section">Cfengine network services</h3>

   <p>By starting the daemon called <code>cfservd</code>, you can set up a line of
communication between hosts, allowing them to exchange files across
the network or execute cfengine remotely on another system. 
Cfengine network services are built around the following components:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>cfagent</code>
     <dd>The configuration engine, whose only contact with the network is via
remote copy requests. This component does the hard work of configuring
the system based on rules specified in the file <code>cfagent.conf</code>. It
does not and cannot grant any access to a system from the network.

     <br><dt><code>cfservd</code>
     <dd>A daemon which acts as both a file server and a remote-cfagent
executor. This daemon authenticates requests from the network and
processes them according to rules specified in <code>cfservd.conf</code>. 
It works as a file server and as a mechanism for starting
cfagent on a local host and piping its output back to the
network connection.

     <br><dt><code>cfrun</code>
     <dd>This is a simple initiation program which can be used
to run cfagent on a number of remote hosts. It cannot
be used to tell cfagent what to do, it can only ask cfagent
on the remote host to run the configuration file it already
has. Anyone could be allowed to run this program, it does not
require any special user privileges. A locking mechanism
in cfengine prevents its abuse by spamming.

     <br><dt><code>cfwatch</code>
     <dd>This program (which is not a part of the distribution: it is left for
others to implement) should provide a graphical user interface for
watching over the configuration of hosts running cfagent and logging
their output.

   </dl>

<p>With these components you can emulate programs like <code>rdist</code>
whose job it is to check and maintain copies of files on client machines. 
You may also decide who has permission to run cfagent and how often it
may be run, without giving away any special user privileges.

<h4 class="subsection">Remote file distribution</h4>

   <p>This section describes how you can set up <code>cfservd</code> as a remote file
server which can result in the distrubution of files to client hosts in
a more democratic way than with programs like rdist.

   <p>An important difference between cfengine and other systems has to do
with the way files are distributed.  Cfengine uses a `pull' rather than a
`push' model for distributing network files.  The <code>rdist</code> command,
for instance, works by forcing an image of the files on one server
machine onto all clients.  Files get changed when the server wishes it
and the clients have no choice but to live with the consequences. 
Cfengine cannot force its will onto other hosts in this way, it can only
signal them and ask them to collect files if they want to. In other
words, cfengine simulates a `push' model by polling each client and
running the local cfengine configuration script giving the host the
chance to `pull' any updated files from the remote server, but
leaving it up to the client machine to decide whether or not it
wants to update.

   <p>Also, in contrast to programs like <code>rdist</code> which distribute files
over many hosts, cfengine does not require any general <code>root</code>
access to a system using the <code>.rhosts</code> file or the
<code>/etc/hosts.equiv</code> file. It is sufficient to run the daemon as
root.  You can not run it by adding it to the <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code>
file on your system however. 
The restricted functionality of the daemon protects your system from
attempts to execute general commands as the root user using <code>rsh</code>.

   <p>To remotely access files on a server, you add the keyword <code>server=</code><var>host</var><code></code>
to a copy command. Consider the following example
which illustrates how you might distribute a password file from a masterhost
to some clients.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     copy:
     
       PasswdClients::
     
         /etc/passwd  dest=/etc/passwd owner=root group=0 server=<var>server-host</var>
     
     </pre>

<p>Given that the <code>cfservd</code> daemon is running on <var>server-host</var>, cfagent
will make contact with the daemon and attempt to obtain information
about the file. During this process, cfengine verifies that the system
clocks of the two hosts are reasonably synchronized. If they are not,
it will not permit remote copying. 
If cfagent determines that a file needs to be updated from a remote
server it begins copying the remote file to a new file on the same
filesystem as the destination-file. This file has the suffix <code>.cfnew</code>. 
Only when the file has been successfully collected will cfagent make a
copy of the old file, (see <code>repository</code> in the Reference manual),
and rename the new file into place. This behaviour is designed to avoid
race-conditions which can occur during network connections and indeed
any operations which take some time. If files were simply copied
directly to their new destinations it is conceivable that a network
error could interrupt the transfer leaving a corrupted file in place.

   <p>Cfagent places a timeout of a few seconds on network connections to
avoid hanging processes.

   <p>Normally the daemon sleeps, waiting for connections from the network. 
Such a connection may be initiated by a request for remote files from a
running cfengine program on another host, or it might be initiated by
the program <code>cfrun</code> which simply asks the
host running the daemon to run the cfengine program locally.

<h4 class="subsection">Remote execution of cfagent</h4>

   <p>It is a good idea to execute cfagent by getting <code>cron</code> to
run it regularly.  This ensures that cfagent will be run even if you are
unable to log onto a host to run it yourself. Sometimes however you
will want to run cfagent immediately in order to implement a change in
configuration as quickly as possible. It would then be inconvenient
to have to log onto every host in order to do this manually. A better
way would be to issue a simple command which contacted a remote host and
ran cfagent, printing the output on your own screen:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     myhost% cfrun <var>remote-host</var> -v
     
      <var>output....</var>
     
     </pre>

<p>A simple user interface is provided to accomplish this. <code>cfrun</code>
makes a connection to a remote cfservd-daemon
and executes cfagent on that system with the privileges of the
cfservd-daemon (usually <code>root</code>). This has a two advantages:

     <ul>

     <li>You avoid having to log in on a remote host in order to reconfigure
it.

     <li>Users other than root can run cfagent to fix any problems with
the system.

   </ul>

   <p>A potential disadvantage with such a system is that malicious users
might be able to run cfagent on remote hosts. The fact
that non-root users can execute cfagent is not a problem in itself,
after all the most malicious thing they would be able to do would
be to check the system configuration and repair any problems. 
No one can tell cfagent what to do using the cfrun program, it
is only  possible to run an existing configuration. 
But a more serious concern is that malicious users might try to run cfagent
repeatedly (so-called `spamming') so that a system became burdened
with running cfagent constantly, See <a href="#Spamming%20and%20security">Spamming and security</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">Spamming and security</h4>

   <p>The term `spamming' refers to the senseless repetition of something in a
malicious way intended to drive someone crazy<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5"><sup>5</sup></a>. In the computer world some
malicious users, a bit like `flashers' in the park<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6"><sup>6</sup></a> like to run around the
net a reveal themselves ad nauseum by sending multiple mail messages or
making network connections repeatedly to try to overload systems and
people<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-7"><sup>7</sup></a>.

   <p>Whenever we open a system to the network, this problem becomes a concern. 
Cfengine is a tool for making peace with networked systems, not a tool
to be manipulated into acts of senseless aggression. The cfservd daemon
does make it possible for anyone to connect and run a cfengine process
however, so clearly some protection is required from such attacks.

   <p>Cfengine's solution to this problem is a locking mechanism. Rather than
providing user-based control, cfengine uses a time based locking
mechanism which prevents actions from being executed unless a certain
minimum time has elapsed since the last time they were executed. 
By using a lock which is not based on user identity, we protect
several interests in one go:

     <ul>

     <li>Restricting cfengine access to root would prevent regular users,
in trouble, from being able to fix problems when the system
administrator was unavailable. A time-based lock does not
prevent this kind of freedom.

     <li>Accidents with cron or shell scripts could start cfagent
more often than desirable. We also need to protect against
such accidents.

     <li>We can prevent malicious attacks regardless of whom they may
come from.

   </ul>

   <p>Cfengine is controlled by a series of locks which prevent it from
being run too often, and which prevent it from spending too long trying
to do its job. The locks work in such a way that you can start several
cfengine processes simultaneously without them crashing into each
other. Coexisting cfengine processes are also prevented from trying to
do the same thing at the same time (we call this `spamming'). 
You can control two things about each kind of action in the action
sequence:

     <ul>

     <li>The minimum time which should have passed since the last time
that action was executed. It will not be executed again until
this amount of time has elapsed. 
(Default time is 1 minute.)

     <li>The maximum amount of time cfagent should wait for an old
instantiation of cfagent to finish before killing it
and starting again. (Default time is 120 minutes.)

   </ul>

<p>You can set these values either globally (for all
actions) or for each action separately. If you
set global and local values, the local values override
the global ones. All times are written in units
of <em>minutes</em>.

<pre class="smallexample">     
        actionsequence
          (
          action.IfElapsed<var>time-in-mins</var>
          action.ExpireAfter<var>time-in-mins</var>
          )
     
     </pre>

<p>or globally,

<pre class="smallexample">     
       control:
     
          IfElapsed   = ( <var>time-in-mins</var> )
     
          ExpireAfter = ( <var>time-in-mins</var> )
     
     </pre>

<p>For example:

<pre class="smallexample">     
      control:
     
        actionsequence =
          (
          files.IfElapsed240.ExpireAfter180
          copy
          tidy
          )
     
        IfElapsed = ( 30 )
     
     </pre>

   <p>In this example, we treat the files action differently to the others. 
For all the other actions, cfagent will only execute the files part of
the program if 30 minutes have elapsed since it was last run. Since no
value is set, the expiry time for actions is 60 minutes, which means
that any cfagent process which is still trying to finish up after 60
minutes will be killed automatically by the next cfagent which gets
started.

   <p>As for the files action: this will only be run if 240 minutes
(4 hours) have elapsed since the last run. Similarly, it will
not be killed while processing `files' until after 180 minutes
(3 hours) have passed.

   <p>These locks do not prevent the whole of cfagent from running,
only so-called `atoms'. Several different atoms can be
run concurrently by different cfagents. 
Assuming that the time conditions set above allow you to start
cfengine, the locks ensure that atoms will never
be started by two cfagents at the same time, causing
contention and wasting CPU cycles. 
Atoms are defined to maximize the security of your system
and to be efficient. If cfengine were to lock each file
it looked at seperately, it would use a large amount of
time processing the locks, so it doesn't do that. Instead,
it groups things together like this:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>copy, editfiles, shellcommands</code>
     <dd>Each separate command has its own lock. This means that several
such actions can be processed concurrently by several cfagent
processes. Multiple or recursive copies and edits are
treated as a single object.

     <br><dt><code>netconfig, resolve, umount, mailcheck, addmounts, disable, processes</code>
     <dd>All commands of this action-type are locked simultaneously,
since they can lead to contention.

     <br><dt><code>mountall, mountinfo, required, checktimezone</code>
     <dd>These are not locked at all.

   </dl>

   <p>Cfagent creates a directory <code>~/.cfengine</code> for writing lock files
for ordinary users.

   <p>The option <code>-K</code> or <code>--no-lock</code> can be used to switch off the
locking checks, but note that when running cfagent remotely via <code>cfservd</code>,
this is not possible.

<h4 class="subsection">Some points on the cfservd protocol</h4>

   <p>Cfservd uses a form for host-based authorization. Each atomic operation,
such as statting, getting files, reading directories etc, requires a new
connection and each connection is verified by a double reverse lookup in
the server's DNS records.  Single stat structures are cached during the
processing of a file.

   <p>MD5 checksums are transferred from client to server to avoid loading the
server.  Even if a user could corrupt the MD5 checksum, he or she would
have to get past IP address access control and the worst that could
happen would be to get the right version of the file.  Again this is in
keeping with the idea that users can only harm themselves and not others
with cfengine.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">Deadlocks and runaway loops</h4>

   <p>Whenever we allow concurrent processes to share a resource, we open
ourselves up the possibilty of deadlock. This is a situation where two
or more processes are locked in a vicious stalemate from which none can
escape. Another problem is that it might be possible to start an infinite loop:
cfagent starts itself.

   <p>Cfagent protects you from such loops to a large
degree. It should not be possible to make such a loop by accident. 
The reason for this is the locking mechanism which prevents tasks
being repeated too often. If you start a cfagent process which
contains a shell-command to start cfagent again, this shell
command will be locked, so it will not be possible to run it
a second time. So while you might be able to start a second
cfagent process, further processes will not be started and
you will simply have wasted a little CPU time. When the first
cfagent returns, the tasks which the second cfagent completed
will not be repeated unless you have set the <code>IfElapsed</code> time
or the <code>ExpireAfter</code> time to zero. 
In general, if you wish to avoid problems like this, you
should not disable the locking mechanism by setting these two
times to zero.

   <p>The possibility of deadlock arises in network connection. Cfengine will
not attempt to use the network to copy a file which can be copied
internally from some machine to itself. It will always replace the
<code>server=</code> directive in a copy with `localhost' to avoid unnecessary
network connections. 
This prevents one kind of deadlock which could occur: namely cfrun
executes cfagent on host A (cfservd on host A is then blocked until this
completes), but the host A configuration file contains a remote copy
from itself to itself.  This remote copy would then have to wait for cfservd
to unblock, but this would be impossible since cfservd cannot unblock until
it has the file. By avoiding remote copies to localhost, this possibility
is avoided.

<h4 class="subsection">Installation of <code>cfservd</code></h4>

   <p>To install the cfservd daemon component, you will need to register a
port for cfengine by adding the following line to the system file
<code>/etc/services file</code>
<pre class="smallexample">     
        cfengine        5308/tcp
     
     </pre>

<p>You could do this for all hosts by adding the following to your
cfengine configuration
<pre class="smallexample">     
     editfiles:
     
       { /etc/services
     
        AppendIfNoSuchLine "cfengine        5308/tcp"
       }
     
     </pre>

<p>To start cfservd at boot time, you need to place a line
of the following type in your system startup files:

<pre class="smallexample">     
     # Start cfengine server
     cfservd
     
     </pre>

<p>Note that <code>cfservd</code> will re-read its configuration file whenever
it detects that it has been changed, so you should not have to restart
the daemon, not send it the HUP signal as with other daemons.

<h4 class="subsection">Configuration file <code>cfservd.conf</code></h4>

   <p>The server daemon is controlled by a file called
<code>cfservd.conf</code>. 
The syntax of this configuration file is deliberately modelled on
cfengine's own configuration file, but despite the similarities, you cannot
mix the contents of the two files.

   <p>Though they are not compatible, <code>cfagent.conf</code> and <code>cfservd.conf</code>
are similar in several ways:

     <ul>

     <li>Both files use classes to label entries, so that you may use
the same configuration file to control all hosts on your network. This
is a convenience which saves you the trouble of maintaining many
different files.

     <li>Both files are searched for using the contents of the variable
<code>CFINPUTS</code>.

     <li>You can use <code>groups</code> and <code>import</code> in both files
to break up files into convenient modules and to import
common resources, such as lists of groups.

   </ul>

   <p>Note that the classes in the <code>cfservd.conf</code> file do not tell you the
classes of host which have access to files and directories, but rather
which classes of host pay attention to the access and deny commands when
the file is parsed.

   <p>Host name authentication is not by class or group but by hostname, like
the <code>/etc/exports</code> file on most Unix systems. The syntax for the
file is as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">     
      control:
     
        <var>classes</var>::
     
            domain = ( <var>DNS-domain-name</var> )
     
            cfrunCommand = ( "<var>script/filename</var>" )  # Quoted
     
            MaxConnections = ( <var>maximum number of forked daemons</var> )
     
            ChecksumDatabase = ( <var>filename</var> )
     
            IfElapsed = ( <var>time-in-minutes</var> )
     
            DenyBadClocks = ( <var>false</var> )
     
            AllowConnectionsFrom = ( <var>IP numbers</var> )
     
            DenyConnectionsFrom = ( <var>IP numbers</var> )
     
            AllMultipleConnectionsFrom = ( <var>IP numbers</var> )
     
            LogAllConnections = ( <var>false/true</var> )
     
            SkipVerify = ( <var>IP numbers</var> )
     
      groups:
     
        <var>Group definitions</var>
     
      import:
     
        <var>Files to import</var>
     
      admit: | grant:
     
        <var>classes</var>::
     
           /<var>file-or-directory</var>
     
             <var>wildcards/hostnames</var>
     
      deny:
     
        <var>classes</var>::
     
           /<var>file-or-directory</var>
     
             <var>wildcards/hostnames</var> root=<var>hostlist</var> encrypt=<var>true/on</var>
     
     </pre>


<p>See the reference manual for descriptions of these elements. 
The file consists of a control section and access information. 
You may use the control section to define any variables which
you want to use, for convenience, in the remainder of your file.

   <p>Following the control section, comes a list of files or directories and
hosts which may access these. If permissions are granted to a directory
then all subdirectories are automatically granted also. Note that
plain-file symbolic links are not checked for, so you may need to
specifically deny access to links if they are plain files, but cfservd
does not follow directory symbolic links and give access to files in
directories pointed to by these.

   <p>Fully qualified hostnames should be used in this file. If host names
are unqualified, the current domain is appended to them (do not forget to
define the domain name). Authentication calls the Unix function
<code>gethostbyname()</code> and so on to identify and verify connecting
hosts, so the names in the file must reflect the type on names returned
by this function. You may use wildcards in names to match, for instance,
all hosts from a particular domain.

   <p>Computer security is about protecting the data and availability of an
association of hosts. Briefly, the key words are authentication, privacy,
integrity and trust.  To understand computer security we have to
understand the interrelationships between all of the hosts and
services on our networks as well as the ways in which those hosts can
be accessed.  Tools which allow this kind of management are complex
and usually expensive.

<h3 class="section">What is security?</h3>

   <p>For a computer to be secure it must be *physically secure* -- if
we can get our hands on a host then we are never more than a
screwdriver away from all of its assets--but assuming that hosts are
physically secure, we then wish to deal with the issues of software
security which is a much more difficult topic.  Software security is
about access control and software reliability.  No single tool can
make computer systems secure.  Major blunders have been made out of
the belief that a single product (e.g. a `firewall') would solve the
security problem. For instance, a few years ago a cracker deleted all
the user directories from a dialup login server belonging to a major
Norwegian telecommunications company, from the comfort of his web
browser. This was possible, even through a firewall, because the web
server on the host concerned was incorrectly configured. The bottom
line is that there is no such thing as a secure operating system, firewall
 or none.  What is required is a persistent mixture of vigilence and
adaptability.

   <p>For many, security is perceived as being synonymous with network
privacy or network intrusion.  Privacy is one aspect of security, but
it is not the network which is our special enemy. Many breaches of
security happen from within. There is little difference between the
dangers of remote access from the network or direct access from a
console: privacy is about access control, no matter where the
potential intruder might be.  If we focus exclusively on network
connectivity we ignore a possible threat from internal employees
(e.g. the janitor who is a computer expert and has an axe to grind, or
the mischievous son of the director who was left waiting to play mom's
office, or perhaps the unthinkable: a disgruntled employee who feels
as though his/her talents go unappreciated).  Software security is a
vast subject, because modern computer systems are complex. It is only
exacerbated by the connectivity of the internet which allows millions
of people to have a go at breaking into networked systems. What this
points to is the fact that a secure environment requires a tight
control of access control on every host individually, not merely
at specific points such as firewalls.

   <p>This article is not a comprehensive guide to security. Rather it is an
attempt to illustrate how cfengine can be used to help you automate a
level of host integrity on all the hosts of your network.  Cfengine is a
network configuration tool with two facets.  It is a language used to
build an `expert system'. An expert system describes the way you would
like your hosts and network to look and behave. CFengine is also a
software robot which compares the model you have described with what the
world really looks like and then sets to work correcting any deviations
from that picture.  In many ways it is like an immune system,
neutralizing and repairing damaged parts. Unlike many shell-script
packages for sysadmin, cfengine is a C program which means light on
system resources. Also it works on a principle of
`convergence'. Convergence means that each time you run cfengine the
system should get closer to the model which you have described until
eventually when the system is the model, cfengine becomes quiescent,
just like an immune system. In the words of one user your hosts `never
get worse'. This assumes of course that the model you have is what you
really want. Using cfengine, model building becomes synonymous with
formulating and formalizing a system policy.

   <p>What makes cfengine a security tool is that security
policy is a part of system policy: you cannot have one without the
other.  You will never have security unless you are in control of your
network.  Cfengine monitors and indeed repairs hosts with simple
easily controllable actions.  From an automation perspective, security
is no different from the general day to day business of system
maintenance, you just need to pay more attention to the details. We
cannot speak of `have security' and `have not security'. There is
always security, it is simply a matter of degree: weak or strong;
effective or ineffective.

   <p>Before starting it is only proper to state the obvious. You should
never trust anyone's advice about configuration or security without
running it past your own grey matter first. The examples provided here
are just that: examples. They might apply to you as written and they
might need to be modified. You should never accept and use an example
without thinking carefully and critically first! 
Also, in any book of recipies or guide to successful living you
know that there are simplified answers to complex questions and
you should treat them as such. There is no substitute for real
understanding.

<h3 class="section">Automation</h3>

   <p>Even in the smallest local area network you will want to build a
scheme for automating host configuration and maintenance, because
networks have a way of growing from one host into many quite quickly. 
It is therefore important to build a model which scales. A major
reason for using cfengine is precisely for scalability. Whether you
have one host or a hundred makes little difference. Cfengine is
instructed from a central location, but its operation is completely
and evenly spread across the network. Each host is responsible
for obtaining a copy of the network model from a trusted source
and is then responsible for configuring itself without intervention
from outside. Unlike some models, cfengine does not have to rely on
network communication or remote object models.

   <p>We also need
integration, or the ability to manage the interrelationships between
hosts.  It is no good having complete control of one important host
and thinking that you are secure. If an intruder can get into any
host, he or she is almost certain to get into the ones that matter,
especially if you are not looking at all of them.  Using cfengine is a
good way of forcing yourself to formulate a configuration/security
policy and then stick to it.  Why cfengine?  There are three reasons:
i) it forces a discipline of preparation which focuses you on the
problems at the right level of detail, ii) it provides you with
`secure' scalable automation and a common interface to all your hosts,
and iii) it scales to any number of hosts without additional burdens. 
We'll need to qualify some of these points below.

   <p>The first step in security management is to figure out a security
policy. That way, you know what *you* mean by security and if that
security is breached, you will know what to do. In many cases you can
formulate a large part of your security policy as cfengine code. That
makes it formal, accurate and it means that it will get done by the
robot without requiring any more work on your part.

   <p>As an immune system, cfengine will even work fine in a partially
connected environment it makes each host responsible for its own
state.  It is not reliant on network connectivty for remote method
invocations or CORBA-style object requests as is, say, Tivoli. All it needs is an
authentic copy of the network configuration document stored locally on
each host.  If this is the case, a detached host will not be left
unprotected, at worst it might lag behind in its version of the
network configuration.

<h3 class="section">Trust</h3>

   <p>There are many implicit trust relationships in computer systems. 
It is crucial to understand them. If you do not understand where
you are placing your trust, your trust can be exploited by
attackers who have thought more carefully than you have.

   <p>For example, any NFS server of users' home-directories trusts the root
user on the hosts which mount those directories.  Some bad accidents
are prevented by mapping root to the user nobody on remote systems,
but this is not security, only convenience.  The root user can always
use `su' to becomes any user in its password file and access/change
any data within those filesystems. The .rlogin and hosts.equiv files
on Unix machines grant root (or other user) privileges to other hosts
without the need for authentication.

   <p>If you are collecting software from remote servers, you should make
sure that they come from a machine that you trust, particularly if
they are files which could lead to privileged access to your system. 
Even checksums are no good unless they also are trustworthy. 
For example, it would be an extremely foolish idea to copy a binary
program such as /bin/ps from a host you know nothing about.  This
program runs with root privileges. If someone were to replace that
version of ps with a Trojan horse command, you would have effectively
opened your system to attack. Most users trust anonymous FTP servers
where they collect free software.  In any remote copy you are setting
up an implicit trust relationship.  First of all you trust integrity
of the host you are collecting files from.  Secondly you trust that
they have the same username database with regard to access
control. The root user on the collecting host has the same rights to
read files as the root user on the server. The same applies to any
matched user name.

<h3 class="section">Why trust cfengine?</h3>

   <p>Cfengine has a very simple trust model. It trusts the integrity of its
input file and any data which is explicitly chooses to download. 
Cfengine places the responsibility on root on the localhost not
on any outsiders. *You* can make cfengine destroy your system, just as
you can destroy it yourself, but no one else can, so as long as you
are careful with the input file you are trusting essentially no-one. 
We shall qualify this below for remote file copying.

   <p>Cfengine assumes that its input file is secure. Apart from that input
file, no part of cfengine accepts or uses any configuration
information from outside sources.  The most one could do from an
authenticated network connection is to ask cfengine to carry out (or
not) certain parts of its model, thus in the worst case scanario an
outside attacker could spoof cfengine into configuring the host
correctly.  In short, no one except root on the localhost can force cfengine
to do anything (unless root access to your system has already been
compromised by another route). This means that there is a single point
of failure. The input file does not even have to be private as long as
it is authentic. No one except you can tell cfengine what to do.

   <p>There is a catch though. Cfengine can be used to perform remote file
transfer.  In remote file transfer one is also forced to trust the
integrity of the data received, just as in any remote copy scheme. 
Although cfengine works hard to authenticate the identity of the host,
once the host's identity is verified it cannot verify the accuracy of
unknown data it has been asked to receive.  Also, as with all remote
file transfers, cfengine could be tricked by a DNS spoofing into
connecting to an imposter host, so use the IP addresses of hosts, not
their names if you don't trust your DNS service.  In short, these
faults are implicit in remote copying. They do not have to do with
cfengine itself.  This has nothing to do with encryption as users
sometimes believe: encrypted connections do not change these trust
relationships--they improve the privacy of the data being transmitted
not their accuracy or trustworthiness.

   <p>The point of cfengine is normally to have only one global
configuration for every host. This needs to be distributed somehow
which means that hosts must collect this file from a remote server. 
This in turn means that you must trust the host which has the master
copy of the cfengine configuration file.

<h3 class="section">Configuration</h3>

   <p>The beginning of security is correct host configuration. Even if
you have a firewall shielding you from outside intrusion, an
incorrectly configured host is a security risk. Host configuration
is what cfengine is about, so we could easily write a book on this. 
Rather than reiterating the extensive documentation, let's just
consider a few examples which address actual problems and get
down to business without further ado.

   <p>A cfengine configuration file is composed of objects with the
following syntax (see the cfengine documentation):
<pre class="smallexample">       rule-type:
     
         classes-of-host-this-applies-to::
     
               Actual rule 1
               Actual rule 2 ...
     
     </pre>
   The rule-types include checking file permissions, editing textfiles,
disabling (renaming and removing permissions to) files, controlled
execution of scripts and a variety of other things relating to host
configuration. Some of the `control' rules are simply flags which
switch on complex (read `smart') behaviour. 
Every cfengine program needs an actionsequence which tells it
the order in which bulk configuration operations should be
evaluated. e.g.

<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
       actionsequence = ( netconfig copy processes editfiles )
     
     </pre>
   You should look at the cfengine manual to get started
with your configuration.

   <p>Let us step through
some basic idioms which can repeated in different contexts.

   <p>As representative examples we shall take solaris and GNU/Linux
as example operating systems. This is not to single them out
as being particularly secure or insecure, it is merely due to their
widespread use and for definiteness.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Disabling and replacing software</h3>

   <p>One of the simplest things which we are asked to do constantly
is to disable dangerous programs as bugs are discovered. CERT
security warnings frequently warn about programs with flaws
which can compromise a system. In cfengine, disabling a file
means renaming it to *.cf-disabled and setting its permission to 400.
<pre class="smallexample">      disable:
     
        #
        # CERT security patches
        #
     
        solaris::
     
          /usr/openwin/bin/kcms_calibrate
          /usr/openwin/bin/kcms_configure
          /usr/bin/admintool
          /etc/rc2.d/S99dtlogin
          /usr/lib/expreserve
     
        linux::
     
           /sbin/dip-3.3.7n
           /etc/sudoers
           /usr/bin/sudoers
     
     </pre>
   Although this is a trivial matter, the fact that it is automated means
that cfengine is checking for this all the time. As long as a host is
up and running (connected to the network or not) cfengine will be
ensuring the named file is not present.

   <p>Another issue is to replace standard vendor programs with drop-in replacements. 
For example, most admins would like to replace their vendor sendmail
with the latest update from Eric Allman's site. One way to do this
is to compile the new sendmail into a special directory, separate
from vendor files and then to symbolically link the new program into
place.
<pre class="smallexample">     
      links:
     
        solaris||linux::
     
         /usr/lib/sendmail      -&gt;!  /usr/local/lib/mail/bin/sendmail-8.9.3
         /usr/sbin/sendmail     -&gt;!  /usr/local/lib/mail/bin/sendmail-8.9.3
         /etc/mail/sendmail.cf  -&gt;!  /usr/local/lib/mail/etc/sendmail.cf
     
     </pre>
   The exclamation marks mean (by analogy with the csh) that existing
file objects should be replaced by links to the named files. Again
the integrity of these links is tested every time cfengine runs. 
If the object /usr/lib/sendmail is not a link to the named file, the old
file is moved and a link is made. If the link is okay, nothing happens. 
After putting the new sendmail in place, you will need to
make sure that the restricted shell configuration is in order.

<pre class="smallexample">        #
        # Sendmail, restricted shell needs these links
        #
     
        solaris::
     
          # Most of these will only be run on the MailHost
          # but flist (procmail) is run during sending...
     
          /usr/adm/sm.bin/vacation -&gt; /usr/ucb/vacation
          /usr/adm/sm.bin/flist   -&gt;  /home/listmgr/.bin/flist
     
        linux::
     
          /usr/adm/sm.bin/vacation -&gt; /usr/bin/vacation
     
     </pre>

   <p>Link management is a particularly useful feature of cfengine. 
By putting links (actually all system modifications) into the
cfengine configuration and never doing anything by hand,
you build up a system which is robust to reinstallation. If you
lose your host, you just have to run cfengine once or twice
to reconstruct it.

   <p>Of course, the fundamental tenet of security is to be able to
restrict privilege to resources. We therefore need to check the permissions on
files. For instance, a recent CERT advisory warned of problems with
some free unix mount commands which were setuid root. If we suppose
there is a group of hosts called `securehosts' which we don't need to worry
about, then we could remove the setuid bits on all other hosts as
follows:
<pre class="smallexample">     
      files:
     
        !securehosts.linux::
     
           /bin/mount     mode=555 owner=root action=fixall
           /bin/umount    mode=555 owner=root action=fixall
     
        securehosts.linux::
     
           /bin/mount      m=6555 o=root action=fixall
           /bin/umount     m=6555 o=root action=fixall
     
     </pre>
   One area where cfengine excels over other tools is in its ascii file
editing abilities. Editing textfiles in a non-destructive way is such
an important operation that having used it you will wonder how you
every managed without it! Here are some simple but real examples
of how file editing can be used.
<pre class="smallexample">     
      editfiles:
     
        # sun4, who are they kidding?
     
        { /etc/hosts.equiv
     
        HashCommentLinesContaining "+"
        }
     
        #
        # CERT security patch for vold vulnerability
        #
     
        sunos_5_4::
     
           { /etc/rmmount.conf
     
           HashCommentLinesContaining "action cdrom"
           HashCommentLinesContaining "action floppy"
           }
     
     </pre>
   TCP wrapper configuration can be managed easily by maintaining
a pair of master files on a trusted host. Files of the form
<pre class="smallexample">     
      # /etc/hosts.allow (exceptions)
      #
      # Public services
     
      sendmail: ALL
      in.ftpd:  ALL
      sshd:     ALL
     
      # Private services
     
      in.fingerd:  .example.org LOCAL
      in.cfingerd: .example.org LOCAL
      sshdfwd-X11: .example.org LOCAL
     
      # Portmapper has to use IP series
     
      portmap: 128.39.89. 128.39.74. 128.39.75.
     </pre>
   and
<pre class="smallexample">     
      # /etc/hosts.deny (default)
     
      ALL: ALL
     
     </pre>
   may be distributed to each host by cfengine
<pre class="smallexample">     copy:
     
      /masterfiles/hosts.deny dest=/etc/hosts.deny
                              mode=644
                              server=trusted
      /masterfiles/hosts.allow dest=/etc/hosts.allow
                               mode=644
                               server=trusted
     </pre>
   and installed as follows
<pre class="smallexample">      editfiles:
     
           { /etc/inet/inetd.conf
     
           # Make sure we're using tcp wrappers
     
           ReplaceAll "/usr/sbin/in.ftpd"    With "/local/sbin/tcpd"
           ReplaceAll "/usr/sbin/in.telnetd" With "/local/sbin/tcpd"
           ReplaceAll "/usr/sbin/in.rshd"    With "/local/sbin/tcpd"
           ReplaceAll "/usr/sbin/in.rlogind" With "/local/sbin/tcpd"
     
      processes:
     
           "inetd" signal=hup
     
     </pre>
   The services which we do not need should be removed altogether. 
There's no sense in tempting fate:
<pre class="smallexample">     
     editfiles:
     
           { /etc/inetd.conf

<h3 class="section">Process monitoring</h3>

   <p>When it comes to process management we are usually interested in
three things: i) making sure certain processes are running,
ii) making sure some processes are NOT running and iii)
sending HUP signals to force configuration updates. 
To HUP a daemon and make sure that it is running, we write
<pre class="smallexample">     processes:
     
      linux::
     
       "inetd"  signal=hup restart "/usr/sbin/inetd"   useshell=false
       "xntp"              restart "/local/sbin/xntpd" useshell=false
     
     </pre>
   The useshell option tells cfengine that it should not use a shell
to start the program. The idea here is to protect against IFS attacks. 
Unfortunately some programs require a shell in order to be started,
but most do not. This is an extra precaution. 
When the cron daemon crashes, restarting it can be a problem
since it does not close its filed descriptors properly when forking. 
The dumb-option helps here:
<pre class="smallexample">     
       "cron" matches=&gt;1 restart "/etc/init.d/cron start"  useshell=dumb
     
     </pre>
   To kill processes which should not be running, we write:

<pre class="smallexample">     
      processes:
     
        solaris::
     
        #
        # Don't want CDE stuff or SNMP peepholes...
        #
     
         "ttdbserverd" signal=kill
         "snmpd"       signal=kill
         "mibiisa"     signal=kill
     
     </pre>

   <p>A couple of years ago, a broken cracked account was revealed at
Oslo College by the following test in the cfengine configuration:

<pre class="smallexample">     processes:
     
        # Ping attack ?
     
        "ping"  signal=kill inform=true
     
     </pre>
   There are few legimate reasons to run the ping command more than a few
times. The chances of cfengine detecting single pings is quite small. 
But coordinated ping attacks are another story. When it was revealed
that a user had twenty ping processes attempting to send large ping
packets to hosts in the United States it was obvious the the account
had been compromised. Fortunately for the recipient, the ping command
was incorrectly phrased and would probably not have been noticed.

<pre class="smallexample">     processes:
     
          "sshd"
                       restart "/local/sbin/sshd"
                       useshell=false
     
          "snmp"       signal=kill
          "mibiisa"    signal=kill
     
          "named"      matches=&gt;1
                       restart "/local/bind/bin/named"
                       useshell=false
     
          # Do the network community a service and run this
     
          "identd"   restart "/local/sbin/identd" inform=true
     
     </pre>
   Process management also includes the garbage collection
which we shall return to briefly.

<h3 class="section">Monitoring files</h3>

   <p>Almost all security programs available are for the monitoring of
file integrity. Cfengine also incorporates tools for monitoring
files. Here are some of the elements in the faily complex files
command:
<pre class="smallexample">     
      files:
     
          classes::
     
             /file-object
                               mode=mode
                               owner=uid-list
                               group=gid-list
                               action=fixall/warnall..
                               ignore=pattern
                               include=pattern
                               exclude=pattern

     </pre>

   <p>In additions to these, there are extra flags for BSD filesystems and
ways of managing file ACLs for systems like NT. 
Here are some examples of basic checks on file permissions:

<pre class="smallexample">     
      classes:
     
       # Define a class of hosts based on a test...

   In the last example we parse through a whole file system (recurse=inf)
and as a result we get a number of checks for free. Any previously
unknown setuid programs are reported as well as any suspicious
filenames (see below).

<h3 class="section">The setuid log</h3>

   <p>Cfengine is always on the lookout for files which are setuid or setgid
root.  It doesn't go actively looking for them uninvited, but whenever
you get cfagent to check a file or directory with the files feature,
it will make a note of setuid programs it finds there. These are
recorded in the file cfengine.host.log which is stored under
/var/cfengine or /var/log/cfengine. 
When new setuid programs are discovered, a warning is printed, but only
if you are root. If you ever want a complete list, delete the log
file and cfengine will think that all of the setuid programs it finds
are new. The log file is not readable by normal users.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Suspicious filenames</h3>

   <p>Whenever cfagent opens a directory and scans through files and
directories (recursively) (files, tidy, copy), it is also on the
lookout for for suspicious filenames, i.e. files like "..  ." 
containing only space and/or dots. Such files are seldom created by
sensible sources, but are often used by crackers to try to hide
dangerous programs. Cfagent warns about such files. Although not
necessarily a security issue, cfagent will also warn about filenames
which contain non-printable characters if desired, and directories
which are made to look like plain files by giving them filename
extensions.
<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
        #
        # Security checks
        #
     
        NonAlphaNumFiles = ( on )
        FileExtensions = ( o a c gif jpg html ) # etc
        SuspiciousNames = ( .mo lrk3 lkr3 )
     
     </pre>
   The file extension list may be used to detect concealed directories during
these searches, if users create directories which look like common
files this will be warned about. Additional suspicious filenames
can be checked for automatically as a matter if course. This is commented
further below.

   <p>The mail spool directory is a common place for users to try to hide
dowloaded files. These options inform about files which do not have
the name of a user or are not owned by a valid user:
<pre class="smallexample">     
      control:
     
        WarnNonOwnerMail = ( true )
        WarnNonUserMail = ( true )  # Warn about mail which is not owned by a user
     
     </pre>
   Corresponding commands exist to delete these files without further ado. 
This can be a useful way of cleaning up after users whose accounts
have been removed.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">Checksums and Tripwire functionality</h3>

   <p>Cfagent can be used to check for changes in files which only something
as exacting as an MD5 checksum/digest can detect. If you specify a
checksum database and activate checksum verification,
<pre class="smallexample">     
     control:
     
       ChecksumDatabase = ( /var/cfengine/cache.db )
     
       ChecksumUpdates = ( false )
     
     files:
     
         /filename checksum=md5 ....
         /dirname  checksum=md5 recurse=inf....
     
         # If the database isn't secure, nothing is secure...
     
         /var/cfengine/cache.db  mode=600 owner=root action=fixall
     
     </pre>
   then cfagent will build a database of file checksums and warn you when
files' checksums change. This makes cfagent act like Tripwire
(currently only with MD5 checksums). It can be used to show up Trojan
horse versions of programs. It should be used sparingly though since
database management and MD5 checksum computation are resource
intensive operations and this could add significant time to a cfagent
run. The ChecksumUpdates variable (normally false) can be set to true
to update the checksum database when programs change for valid
reasons.

   <p>Warnings are all every fine and well, but the spirit of cfengine is
not to bother us with warnings, it is to fix things automatically. 
Warning is a useful supplement, but in security breaches it is better
to fix the problem, rather than leaving the host in a dangerous state. 
If you are worried about the integrity of the system then don't just
warn about checksum mismatches here, make an md5 copy comparison
against a read-only medium which has correct, trusted version of the
file on it. That way if a binary is compromised you will not only warn
about it but also repair the damage immediately!

   <p>The control variable ChecksumUpdates may be switched to on
in order to force cfagent to update its checksum database after
warning of a change.

<h3 class="section">FileExtensions</h3>

   <p>This list may be used to define a number of extensions
which are regarded as being plain files by the system. 
As part of the general security checking cfagent will
warn about any directories which have names using
these extensions. They may be used to conceal directories.

<br>
</div>

<h3 class="section">NonAlphaNumFiles</h3>

   <p>If enabled, this option causes cfagent to detect and
disable files which have purely non-alphanumeric
filenames, i.e. files which might be accidental or
deliberately concealed. The files are then marked
with a suffix .cf-nonalpha and are rendered
visible.
<pre class="smallexample">     
       NonAlphaNumFiles = ( on )
     
     </pre>
   These files can then be tidied (deleted) or disabled by searching for
the suffix pattern. Note that alphanumeric means ascii codes less than
32 and greater than 126.

<h3 class="section">Defensive garbage collection</h3>

   <p>We tend to be worried about the fact that crackers will destroy our
systems and make them unusable, but many operating systems are
programmed to do this to themselves!  There are few systems which can
survive a full system disk and yet many logging agents go on filling
up disks without ever checking to see how full they are getting. In
short they choke themselves in a self-styled denial of service attack. 
Cfagent can help here by rotating logs frequently and by tidying
temporary file directories:
<pre class="smallexample">     
     disable:
     
       Tuesday.Hr00::
     
        #
        # Disabling these log files weekly prevents them from
        # growing so enormous that they fill the disk!
        #
     
        /local/iu/httpd/logs/access_log   rotate=2
        /local/iu/httpd/logs/agent_log    rotate=2
        /local/iu/httpd/logs/error_log    rotate=2
        /local/iu/httpd/logs/referer_log  rotate=2
     
       FTPserver.Sunday::
     
        /local/iu/logs/xferlog rotate=3
     
     tidy:
     
         /tmp pattern=* age=1
     
     </pre>

   <p>Process garbage collection is just as important. 
There are lot's of reasons why process tables
fill up with unterminated processes. One example
is faulty X terminal software which does not kill
its children at logout. Another is that programs
like netscape and pine tend to go into loops from
which they never return, gradually loading the system
with an ever increasing glacial burden. Just killing
old processes can cause your system to spring back
from its ice age blues (hopefully without littering
the system with too many dead mammoths or bronze age
axe-bearers). If the host concerned has important
duties then this lack of responsiveness can compromise
key services. It also gives local users a way of carrying
out denial of service attacks on the system.

   <p>If users always log out at the end of the day and
log in again the day after then this is easy to address
with cfengine. Here is some code to kill commonly hanging
processes. Note that on BSD like systems process options
"aux" are required to see the relevant processes:
<pre class="smallexample">     processes:
     
       linux|freebsd|sun4::
     
           SetOptionString "aux"
     
       any::
     
       "Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec"
     
           signal=kill
     
           include=ftpd
           include=tcsh
           include=xterm
           include=netscape
           include=ftp
           include=pine
           include=perl
           include=irc
           include=java
           include=/bin/ls
           include=emacs
           include=passwd
     
     </pre>
   This pattern works like this: as processes become more than a day old
they name of the month appears in the date of the process start
time. These are matched by the regular expression. The include
lines then filter the list of the processes further picking out
lines which include the specified strings. 
On some BSD-like systems the default ps option string is
"-ax" and you might need to reset it to something
which adds the start date in order to make this work.

   <p>Another job for process management is to clean up processes which
have hung, gone amok or which are left over from old logins. Here
is a regular expression which detects non-root processes which
have clocked up more than 100 hours of CPU time. This is a depressingly
common phenomenon when a program goes into an infinite loop. It can
starve other processes of resources in a very efficient denial
of service attack.
<pre class="smallexample">      any::
     
       #
       # Kill processes which have run on for too long e.g. 999:99 cpu time
       # Careful a pattern to match 99:99 will kill everything!
       #
     
       "[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]" signal=term exclude=root
            "[0-9][0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]" signal=term exclude=root
     </pre>
   Under NT this is not so simple, since the process table for
the cygwin library applies only to processes which have been
started by programs working under the Unix process emulation. 
Hopefully this short-coming can be worked around at some point
in the future.

<h3 class="section">Anonymous FTP example</h3>

   <p>Configuring a service like anonymous FTP requires a certain amount of
vigilance. It is a good idea to automate it and let cfengine make sure
that things don't go astray.  Note that we constantly ensure that the
ls program used by the anonymous ftp server is a trusted program by
checking it with an md5 signture of a trusted version of the
program. If for some reason it should be replaced with a Trojan horse,
cfagent would notice the incorrect checksum (md5) and move the bad
program to ls.cf-saved and immediately replace it with the correct
version without waiting for the adminstrator to act. The inform and
syslog options ask for an explicit warning to be made about this copy. 
Here is a complete anonymous ftp setup and maintenance program for

<h3 class="section">WWW security</h3>

   <p>The security of the web is a slightly paradoxical business.  On the
one hand, we make a system for distributing files to anyone without
the need for passwords, and on the other hand we are interested in
limited who gets what information and who can change what. If you want
web privacy you have to exclude the possibility of running untrusted
CGI scripts, i.e. CGI programs which you did not write yourself since
CGI programs can circumvent any server security.  This is because of a
fundamental weakness in the way that a WWW server works.  It makes
user-CGI scripts incompatible with the idea of private WWW areas.

   <p>The problem with CGI is this: in order for the httpd daemon to be able
to read information to publish it, that information must be readable
by the UID with which httpd runs (e.g. the www special user (you
should not run with uid nobody since that can be mixed up with NFS
mappings)).  But CGI programs automatically run with this www UID
also. Since it is not possible to restrict the actions of CGI programs
which you did not write yourself, any CGI program has automatically
normal file permission access to any file which the server can see. A
CGI program could choose to open a restricted file circumventing the
security of the daemon. In short, privacy requires a separate UID (a
separate daemon and port number) or a separate server host altogether.

   <p>Provided you acknowledge this weakness, you can still use cfengine to administrate
the permissions and access files on say two WWW servers from
your central location. Let us imagine having a public WWW server
and a private WWW server and assume that they have a common
user/UID database. We begin by defining a user-ID and group-ID
for the public and private services. These need to have different
ID's in order to prevent the CGI trick mentioned above.

<pre class="smallexample">     editfiles:
     
      wwwpublic::
     
       { $(publicdocroot)/.htaccess
     
       AutoCreate
       EmptyEntireFilePlease
       AppendLine "order deny,allow"
       AppendLine "deny from all"
       AppendLine "allow from all"
       }
     
      wwwprivate::
     
       { $(privatedocroot)/.htaccess
     
       AutoCreate
       EmptyEntireFilePlease
       AppendLine "order deny,allow"
       AppendLine "deny from all"
       AppendLine "allow .example.org"
       }
     
     </pre>
   Your documnts should be owned by a user and group which is
*not* the same as the UID/GID the daemon runs with, otherwise
CGI programs and server-side emebellishments could write and
destroy those files. You will also want to ensure that the files
are readable by the www daemon, so a files command can be used to this end. 
You might want a group of people to have access to the files to
modifiy their contents.

<h3 class="section">Privacy (encryption)</h3>

   <p>Encryption (privacy) is not often a big deal in system
administration. With the exception of the distribution of passwords and secret
keys themselves, there is little or no reason to maintain any level of
privacy when transferring system files (binaries for instance).  If
you find yourself using a tool like cfengine to transmit company
secrets from one place to another you should probably book yourself
into the nearest asylum for a checkup. Cfengine is not about super-secure
communication, but it can be used to perform the simple job of file
distribution through an encrypted link (e.g. as a NIS replacement or
other password distributor). Cfengine uses the triple DES implemenation
in the OpenSSL distribution (or equivalent) to provide
`good enough' privacy during remote copying.

   <p>The most important issue in system security is authentication. 
Without the ability to guarantee the identity of a user or of trusted
information it is impossible to speak of security at all.  Although
services like pidentd can go some way to confirming the identity of a
user, the only non-spoofable way of confirming identity is to use a
shared secret -- i.e. a password. A password works by demanding that
two parties who want to trust one another must both know a piece of
information which untrusted parties do not.

   <p>Following the second world war, the now famous pair, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
were convicted and executed for spying on the U.S. bomb project for
the Soviet Union in 1953. At one point they improvised a clever
password system: a cardboard Jell-O box was torn in two and one half
given to a contact whom they later would need to identify.  The
complex edge shape and colour matching made a complex key quite
impossible to forge. Our bodies use a similar method of receptor
identification of molecules for immune responses as well as for smell
(with some subtleties).  Without matching secrets it is impossible to
prove someone's identity.

   <p>To copy a file over an encrypted link, you write:
<pre class="smallexample">     
      copy:
     
         source dest=destination encrypt=true server=myserver
                                  trustkey=true
     
     </pre>
   Bear in mind that the server must be a trusted host. Privacy won't help
you if the data you are collecting are faulty.  In order to use the
encryption there must be a public/private key pair on each host. The
public key must be known by both hosts. You can use the program cfkey to
generate a new key file. This public key file must then be
distributed. Cfagent/cfrun and cfservd can exchange keys securely over
the network. This is fine, provided you trust the sources of the keys
(how do you know the key is from the host/user who claims to have sent
it?).

   <p>Under encrypted communications cfengine conceals the names and contents
of files. Provided the private key files are private, this has the added side
effect of authenticating both hosts for one another.

   <p>On the server side, you can choose whether root on a client host
should have server-root's privileges to read protected files on the server. In the
<code>cfservd.conf</code> file you make a list:
<pre class="smallexample">     control:
     
       TrustKeysFrom = ( <var>ip-address/series</var> )
     
     admit:
     
       /filetree *.domain.country root=myhost,yourhost
     
       /etc/shadow *.domain.country encrypt=true
     
     </pre>
   In the second example, you can also restrict access to certain
files to encrypted lines, i.e. demand that clients use a private
connection to collect the file, in order to prevent wiretapping.

<h3 class="section">Trust and key races</h3>

   <p>Trust is the central issue in the security of any system. Public
and private keys help you to trust other hosts, only after the genuine,
legitimate public keys have been securely distributed to all relevant
parties. Until that has happened, it is necessary to trust the identity
of remote hosts. Cfengine provides trust policy options which decide
whether keys should be exchanged on trust or not, when remote parties
connect for the first time. If you do not want to blindly trust
keys, you could arrange to exchange key files manually, e.g.

<pre class="smallexample">     scp /var/cfengine/ppkeys/localhost.pub remote:/var/cfengine/ppkeys/root-<var>IP-number</var>.pub
     </pre>

<p>or you could arrange to connect at a specific time, so minimize the chances
of spoofer racing you to the finishing line in transferring a key for a
given user at a given host.

   <p>Note that, even program like ssh which use "privileged ports" are no
longer immune to spoofing. Privileged ports are ports which only the
root user can bind to. The idea used to be, a connection on a privileged
port must have come from a trusted user, because only someone with the
root/Administrator password would be able to bind to a privileged
port. Today, that idea is naive at best. Anyone can set up their own
host, pull the plug on another and spoof an address or user identity -
there are so many ways to attack a system that it is impossible to know
with certainty to whom one is talking over the net. The only security
one has is in being able to keep a secret key. However, if someone
gets there before you, with a fake key, and claims to be you, the receiver
cannot know better. This applies to any and all cryptographic software.

   <p>Cfengine secure copy is not based on SSL/TLS (although it shares some of
the lower level libraries). SSL is not appropriate for a system
administration tool, because it uses a trust model based on a third
party, such as Verisign.  Most adminisrators are not prepared to
pay a fee to register every host on their network, with a trusted third party. 
Cfengine does not use the Secure Shell
protocol either. The ssh protocol is not directly appropriate for a
system management tool, because it provides only unilateral
authentication of user to server. Cfengine authenticates these parties
mutually, i.e.  user to server, and server to user. Moreover, ssh
requires a user to manually accept a key on trust, when the public keys
are unknown to the parties, whereas cfengine works
non-interactively. SSh uses the notion of binding to a trusted port, to
confirm privileged user identity. Cfengine does not make this
assumption.

<h3 class="section">Adaptive locks</h3>

   <p>Cfengine treats all of its operations as transactions
which are locked. Locking prevents contention from competing processes
and it also places reasonable limits on the execution of the program. 
The fact that operations are locked means that several cfengine
programs can coexist without problems. Two locking parameters control
the way in which operations can procure locks.  The IfElapsed
parameter tells operations that they can only be performed if a
certain period of time has elapsed since the last time the action was
performed. This is anti-spamming protection.  The ExpireAfter
parameter tells cfengine that no action should last more than a given
length of time. This is protection against hanging sub-processes.

<h3 class="section">Spoofing</h3>

   <p>Spoofing refers to attempts to masquerade as another host when sending
network transmissions. The cfservd program which can be used to
transfer files or activate cfengine remotely attempts to unmask such
attempts by performing double reverse lookups in the name service. This
verifies by a trusted server that the socket address and the host name
are really who they claim to be.

<h3 class="section">Race conditions in file copying</h3>

   <p>When copying files from a source, it is possible that something
might go wrong during the operation and leave a corrupt file in
place. For example, the disk might become full while copying
a file. This could lead to problems. Cfengine deals with this
by always copying to a new file on the destination filesystem
(prefix .cfnew) and then renaming it into place, only
if the transfer was successful. This ensures that there is
space on the filesystem and that nothing went wrong with
the network connection or the disk during copying.

<h3 class="section">size= in copy</h3>

   <p>As a further check on copying, cfengine allows you to define acceptable
limits on the size of files. After all, sometimes errors might occur
quite independently of anything you are doing with cfengine. Perhaps the
master password file got emptied somehow, or got replaced by a binary,
through some silly mistake. By checking making an estimate of the
expected size of the file and adding it to the copy command, you can
avoid installing a corrupt file and making a localized problem into a
global one.

<h3 class="section">useshell= and owner= in shellcommands</h3>

   <p>There are dangers in starting scripts from programs which run with root
privileges. Normally, shell commands are started by executing them with
the help of a /bin/sh -c command. The trouble with this is that
it leaves one open to a variety of attacks. One example is fooling the
shell into starting foreign programs by manipulating the IFS
variable to treat '/' as a separator. You can ask cfengine to start
programs directly, without involving an intermediary shell, by setting
the useshell variable to false. The disadvantage is that you will
not be able to use shell directives such as | and &gt; in
your commands. The owner=uid directive executes shell commands
as a special user, allowing you to safely run scripts without
root privilege.

<h3 class="section">Firewalls</h3>

   <p>Cfengine is a useful tool for implementing, monitoring and maintaining
firewalls. You can control what programs are supposed to be on the
firewall and what programs are not supposed to be there. You can control
file permissions, processes and a dozen other things which make up the
configuration of a bastion host. 
By referencing important programs against a read only medium you
can not only monitor host integrity but always be certain that
you are never more than a cfengine execution away from correctness.

<h2 class="chapter">Summary</h2>

   <p>Cfengine is not a tool, it is an environment for managing
host configuration and integrity. In this article it has only
been possible to scratch the surface of what cfengine can do. 
To fully understand the syntax of the examples here you should
read the documentation for cfengine.

   <p>The big advantage of cfengine over many other configuration schemes is
that you can have *everything* in one file (or set of files). The
global file is common to every host and yet it can be as general or as
specific as you want it to be.  You can use it as a
front end for cron, and you can use its advanced features to make your
hosts *converge* to a desired, correct state.

<p>Note:
if the filesystem was in the fstab but not actually mounted a warning is
issued telling you that the filesystem was probably not exported

serving the filesystem is out of service.  If this is the case then a
subsequent re-run when the server resumes normal service will succeed.</p>
