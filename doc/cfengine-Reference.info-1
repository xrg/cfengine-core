Inroduction to reference manual
*******************************

   The purpose of the cfengine reference manual is to collect together
and document the raw facts about the different components of cfengine.
Once you have become proficient in the use of cfengine, you will no
longer have need of the tutorial. The reference manual, on the other
hand, changes with each version of cfengine. You will be able to use it
online, or in printed form to find out the details you require to
implement configurations in practice.

Installation
============

   In order to install cfengine, you should first ensure that the
following packages are installed.

     OpenSSL                   http://www.openssl.org
     Berkeley DB 3.2 or later  http://www.sleepycat.com

The preferred method of installation is then
     tar zxf cfengine-x.x.x.tar.gz
     cd cfengine-x.x.x
     ./configure
     make
     make install

This results in binaries being installed in `/usr/local/sbin'.  Since
this is not necessarily a local file system on all hosts, users are
encouraged to keep local copies of the binaries on each host, inside
the cfengine trusted work directory.


File: cfengine-Reference.info,  Node: Work directory,  Next: Hard classes,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Reference introduction

Work directory
==============

   In order to achieve the desired simplifications, it was decided to
reserve a private work area for the cfengine tool-set. In cfengine 1.x,
the administrator could choose the locations of configuration files,
locks, and logging data independently. In cfengine 2.x, this diversity
has been rationalized to a single directory which defaults to
`/var/cfengine' (by analogy with `/var/cron'):

     /var/cfengine
     /var/cfengine/bin
     /var/cfengine/inputs
     /var/cfengine/outputs

   The installation location `/usr/local/sbin' is not necessarily a
local file system, and cannot therefore be trusted i) to be present,
and ii) to be authentic on an arbitrary system.

   Similarly, a trusted cache of the input files must now be maintained
in the `inputs' sub-directory. When cfengine is invoked by the
scheduler, it reads only from this directory. It is up to the user to
keep this cache updated, on each host. This simplifies and consolidates
the cfengine resources in a single place. The environment variable
`CFINPUTS' still overrides this default location, as before, but in its
absence or when called from the scheduler, this becomes the location of
trusted files.  A special configuration file `update.conf' is parsed
and run before the main configuration is parsed, which is used to
ensure that the currently caches policy is up-to-date. This has private
classes and variables.  If no value is set for `CFINPUTS', then the
default location is the trusted cfengine directory
`/var/cfengine/inputs'.

   The `outputs' directory is now a record of spooled run-reports. These
are mailed to the administrator, as previously, or can be copied to
another central location and viewed in an alternative browser..

Cfengine hard classes
=====================

   A single class can be one of several things:

   * The name of an operating system architecture e.g.  `ultrix',
     `sun4' etc.  This is referred to henceforth as a _hard class_.

   * The (unqualified) name of a particular host. If your system
     returns a fully qualified domain name for your host, cfagent
     truncates it so as to unqualify the name.

   * The name of a user-defined group of hosts.

   * A day of the week (in the form `Monday Tuesday Wednesday..').

   * An hour of the day (in the form `Hr00, Hr01 ... Hr23').

   * Minutes in the hour (in the form `Min00, Min17 ... Min45').

   * A five minute interval in the hour (in the form `Min00_05,
     Min05_10 ... Min55_00')

   * A day of the month (in the form `Day1 ... Day31').

   * A month (in the form `January, February, ... December').

   * A year (in the form `Yr1997, Yr2001').

   * An arbitrary user-defined string.  (see the reference manual).

   * The ip-address octets of any active interface, in the form
     (`ipv4_192_0_0_1', `ipv4_192_0_0',`ipv4_192_0',`ipv4_192').


   To see all of the classes define on a particular host, run
     host# cfagent -p -v
   as a privileged user. Note that some of the classes are set only if
a trusted link can be established with cfenvd, i.e. if both are running
with privilege, and the `/var/cfengine/env_data' file is secure.

Evaluated classes
=================

   Cfengine provides a number of in-built functions for evaluating
classes, based on file tests. Using these internal functions is quicker
than calling the shell `test' function. The time functions place their
arguments in chronological order.

`IsNewerThan(F1,F2)'
     True if file 2 is modified more recently than file 1. (mtime)

`AccessedBefore(F1,F2)'
     True if file 1 had its last access earlier than file 2 (atime)

`ChangedBefore(F1,F2)'
     True if file 1's attributes were changed in any way before file
     2's (ctime).

`FileExists(FILE)'
     True if the named file object exists.

`IPRange(ADDRESS-RANGE)'
     True if the current host lies within the specified range

`IsDefined(COMMAND)'
     True of the named variable is defined. NB: `IsDefines(var)', not
     `IsDefined(${var})'

`IsDir(F)'
     True if the named file object is a directory.

`IsLink(F)'
     True if the named file object is a symbolic link.

`IsPlain(F)'
     True if the named file object is a plain file.

`ReturnsZero(COMMAND)'
     True if the named shell command returns with exit code zero (okay).

`Strcmp(S1,S2)'
     True if the strings match exactly.

For example:

     classes:
     
      access_to_dir = ( ReturnsZero(/bin/cd /mydir) )
      compare       = ( ChangedBefore(/etc/passwd_master,/etc/passwd) )
      isplain       = ( IsPlain(/tmp/import) )
      inrange       = ( IPRange(128.39.89.10-15) )
      CIDR          = ( IPRange(128.39.89.10/24) )


File: cfengine-Reference.info,  Node: Filenames and paths,  Prev: Evaluated classes,  Up: Reference introduction

Filenames and paths
===================

   Filenames in Unix-lik operating systems

   The directory separator is the forward slash '/' character. All
references to file locations must be absolute names in cfengine, i.e.
they must begin with a complete specification of which directory they
are in. For example:

     /etc/passwd
     /usr/local/masterfiles/distfile

The only place where it makes sense to refer to a file without a
complete directory specification is when searching through directories
for different kinds of file, e.g.
     tidy:
     
       /home/user pattern=core age=0 recurse=inf

Here, one can write `core' without a path, because one is looking for
any file of that name in a number of directories.

   Cfengine was implemented primarily on Unix-like operating systems,
but has since been ported to Windows operating systems and MacOS X. The
Windows operating systems traditionally use a different filename
convention.  The following are all valid absolute file names under
Windows:
      c:\winnt
      c:/winnt
      /var/cfengine/inputs
      //FILESERVER/share2\dir
   The `drive' name "C:" in Windows refers to a partition or device.
Unlike Unix, Windows does not integrate these seamlessly into a single
file-tree.  This is not a valid absolute filename:
     \var\cfengine\inputs
   Paths beginning with a backslash are assumed to be win32 paths.  They
must begin with a drive letter or double-slash server name.

Cfkey reference
***************

   The very first thing you should do on every host is to establish a
public-private key pair. To do this, you need to run the program
     everyhost# cfkey

on every host. This program needs to produce random numbers, and needs a
source of randomness. A good strategy is to install and run the
`cfenvd' program for a week or two in advance of deploying cfengine 2,
since `cfenvd' collects random events, which are an excellent source of
entropy for random number generation.

   If you get the error message "PRNG not seeded", it means that
insufficient data were found in order to make a random key. In that
case, run `cfenvd' for a few days more and try again.

File: cfengine-Reference.info,  Node: Cfagent Runtime Options,  Prev: The file cfagent.conf,  Up: Cfagent intro

Cfagent runtime options
-----------------------

Note that GNU long options are available with the syntax
`--longoption'.  The long names are given in brackets.

`-a'
     (`--sysadm') Print only the name of the system administrator then
     quit.

`-A'
     (`--auto') Can be used to signify an automatic run of cfengine, as
     opposed to a manual run. The distinction is not predetermined. Use
     of this option currently causes cfengine to ignore locks. This
     option is reserved for future development.

`-b'
     (`--force-net-copy') Normally cfengine detects attempts to copy
     from a server via the network, if they loop back to the localhost.
     It then avoids using the network to make the copy. This option
     forces cfengine to copy using the network. (Yes, someone thinks
     this is useful!)

`-c'
     (`--no-check-files') Do not check file systems for ownership /
     permissions etc.

`-C'
     (`--no-check-mounts') Check mount points for consistency.  If this
     option is specified then directories which lie in the "mount point"
     area are checked to see whether there is anything mounted on them.
     Normally this is _off_ since not all machines use mounted file
     systems in the same way.  e.g.  HPUX does not generally operate
     with partitions, but nevertheless one might wish to mimick a
     partition-like environment there, but it would be irritating to be
     informed that nothing was mounted on the mount point.

`-d'
     (`--debug') Enable debugging output.  Normally you will want to
     send this to a file using the shell script command or a pipe.
     -d1 shows only parsing output.  -d2 shows only runtime action
     output.  -d0 shows both levels. Debugging ouput is intended mainly
     for the author's convenience and is not a supported feature. The
     details of this output may change at any time.

`-D'
     (`--define') Define a compound class symbol of the form
     _alpha.beta.gamma_.

`-e'
     (`--no-edits') Suppress file editing.

`-E'
     (`--enforce-links') Globally force links to be created where plain
     files or links already exist. Since this option is a big hammer,
     you have to use it in interactive mode and answer a yes/no query
     before cfengine will run like this.

`-f'
     (`--file') Parse filename after this switch.  By default cfengine
     looks for a file called _cfengine.conf_ in the current directory.

`-h'
     (`--help') Help information.  Display version banner and options
     summary.

`-H'
     (`--no-hard-classes'). Prevents cfengine from generating any
     internal class name information. Can be used for emulation
     purposes.

`-i'
     (`--no-ifconfig') Do not attempt to configure the local area
     network interface.

`-I'
     (`--inform') Switches on the inform output level, whereby cfengine
     reports everything it changes..

`-k'
     (`--no-copy') Do not copy/image any files.

`-K'
     (`--no-lock') Ignore locks when running.

`-l'
     (`--traverse-links') Normally cfengine does not follow symbolic
     links when recursively parsing directories.  This option will
     force it to do so.

`-L'
     (`--delete-stale-links') Delete links which do not point to
     existing files (except in user home directories, which are not
     touched).

`-m'
     (`--no-mount') Do not attempt to mount file systems or edit the
     filesystem table.

`-M'
     (`--no-modules') Ignore modules in actionsequence.

`-n'
     (`--recon',`--dry-run',`--just-print') No action.  Only print what
     has to be done without actually doing it.

`-N'
     (`--negate',`--undefine') Cancel a set of classes, or undefine
     (set value to _false_) a compound class of the form
     _alpha.beta.gamma_.

`-p'
     (`--parse-only') Parse file and then stop.  Used for checking the
     syntax of a program.  You do not have to be superuser to use this
     option.

`-q'
     (`--no-splay') Switch off host splaying (sleeping).

`-s'
     (`--no-commands') Do not execute scripts or shell commands.

`-S'
     (`--silent') Silence run time warnings.

`-t'
     (`--no-tidy') Do not tidy file systems.

`-u'
     (`--use-env') Causes cfengine to generate an environment variable
     `CFALLCLASSES' which can be read by child processes (scripts). This
     variable contains a summary of all the currently defined classes
     at any given time. This option causes some system 5 systems to
     generate a Bus Error or segmentation fault. The same information
     is available from the cfengine internal variable `$(allclasses)'
     and can be passed as a parameter to scripts.

`-U'
     (`--underscore-classes'). When this option is set, cfengine adds
     an underscore to the beginning of the hard system classes (like
     `_sun4', `_linux' etc. The longer compound classes are not
     underscored, since these are already complex and would unlikely
     result in collisions.) This can be used to avoid naming conflicts
     if you are so unjudicious as to name a host by the name of a hard
     class. Other classes are not affected.

`-v'
     (`--verbose') Verbose mode.  Prints detailed information about
     actions and state.

`-V'
     (`--version') Print only the version string and then quit.

`-x'
     (`--no-preconf') Do not execute the `cf.preconf' net configuration
     file.

`-X'
     (`--no-links') Do not execute the `links' section of a program.

`-w'
     (`--no-warn',`--quiet') Do not print warning messages.

`-z'
     (`--smtp') Print the SMTP server for the LAN (used by cfexecd).

   In version 2.0.4, an abbreviation for actionsequence exclusions was
added:

     $ cfagent --avoid resolve,copy
     $ cfagent --just tidy --just shellcommands

Special variables
=================

   Variables are referred to in either of two different ways, depending
on your taste.  You can use the forms `$(variable)' or `${variable}'.
The variable in braces or parentheses can be the name of any user
defined macro, environment variable or one of the following special
internal variables.

`AllClasses'
     A long string in the form `CFALLCLASSES=class1:class2...'.  This
     variable is a summary of all the defined classes at any given
     time. It is always kept up to date so that scripts can make use of
     cfengine's class data.

`arch'
     The current detailed architecture string--an amalgamation of the
     information from _uname_. Non-definable.

`binserver'
     The default server for binary data.  Non definable.

`ChecksumDatabase'
     If set to the name of a file, cfagent will use this to store
     checksums of important files, and give `tripwire functionality',
     *Note ChecksumDatabase::.

`ChecksumUpdates'
     If set to `on', security information is automatically updated,
     *Note ChecksumUpdates::.

`class'
     The currently defined system hard-class (e.g. `sun4', `hpux').
     Non-definable.

`date'
     The current date string. Note that if you use this in a shell
     command it might be interpreted as a list variable, since it
     contains the default separator `:'.

`domain'
     The currently defined domain.

`faculty'
     The faculty or site as defined in control (see site).

`fqhost'
     The fully qualified (DNS/BIND) hostname of the system, which
     includes the domain name as well.

`host'
     The hostname of the machine running the program.

`ipaddress'
     The numerical form of the internet address of the host currently
     running cfengine.

`MaxCfengines'
     The maximum number of cfengines which should be allowed to
     co-exist concurrently on the system. This can prevent excessive
     load due to unintentional spamming in situations where several
     cfengines are started independently. The default value is
     unlimited.

`ostype'
     A short for of `$(arch)'.

`OutputPrefix'
     This quoted string can be used to change the default `cfengine:'
     prefix on output lines to something else. You might wish to shorten
     the string, or have a different prefix for different hosts. The
     value in this variable is appended with the name of the host. The
     default is equivalent to,
            OutputPrefix = ( "cfengine:$(host):")

`RepChar'
     The character value of the string used by the file repository in
     constructing unique filenames from path names. This is the
     character which replaces `/' (see the reference manual).

`site'
     This variable is identical to `$(faculty)' and may be used
     interchangeably.

`smtpserver'
     The name of the host to which mail output should be sent.

`split'
     The character on which list variables are split (see the reference
     manual).

`sysadm'
     The name or mail address of the system administrator.

`timezone'
     The current timezone as defined in `control'.

`UnderscoreClasses'
     If this is set to `on' cfengine uses hard-classes which begin with
     an underscore, so as to avoid name collisions. See also Runtime
     Options in the Reference manual.

`year'
     The current year.

These variables are kept special because they play a special role in
setting up a system configuration.  You are encouraged to use them to
define fully generalized rules in your programs.  Variables can be used
to advantage in defining filenames, directory names and in passing
arguments to shell commands.  The judicious use of variables can reduce
many definitions to a single one if you plan carefully.

   _NOTE: the above control variables are not case sensitive, unlike
user macros, so you should not define your own macros with these names._


   The following variables are also reserved and may be used to produce
troublesome special characters in strings.
`cr'
     Expands to the carriage-return character.

`dblquote'
     Expands to a double quote `"'

`dollar'
     Expands to `$'.

`lf'
     Expands to a line-feed character (Unix end of line).

`n'
     Expands to a newline character.

`quote'
     Expands to a single quote `''.

`spc'
     Expands simply to a single space. This can be used to place spaces
     in filenames etc.

`tab'
     Expands to a single tab character.

Cfengine classes
================

   A _cfengine action_ looks like this:


     ACTION-TYPE:
     
        COMPOUND-CLASS::
     
            DECLARATION

A single class can be one of several things:

   * The name of an operating system architecture e.g.  `ultrix',
     `sun4' etc.  This is referred to henceforth as a _hard class_.

   * The (unqualified) name of a particular host. If your system
     returns a fully qualified domain name for your host, cfagent
     truncates it so as to unqualify the name.

   * The name of a user-defined group of hosts.

   * A day of the week (in the form `Monday Tuesday Wednesday..').

   * An hour of the day (in the form `Hr00, Hr01 ... Hr23').

   * Minutes in the hour (in the form `Min00, Min17 ... Min45').

   * A five minute interval in the hour (in the form `Min00_05,
     Min05_10 ... Min55_00')

   * A quart hour (in the form `Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4')

   * An abbreviated time with quarter hour specified (in the form
     `Hr00_Q1, Hr23_Q4' etc.)

   * A day of the month (in the form `Day1 ... Day31').

   * A month (in the form `January, February, ... December').

   * A year (in the form `Yr1997, Yr2001').

   * An arbitrary user-defined string.  (see the reference manual).

   * The ip-address octets of any active interface, in the form
     (`ipv4_192_0_0_1', `ipv4_192_0_0',`ipv4_192_0',`ipv4_192').


   A compound class is a sequence of simple classes connected by dots or
`pipe' symbols (vertical bars).  For example:


     myclass.sun4.Monday::
     
     sun4|ultrix|osf::

A compound class evaluates to `true' if all of the individual classes
are separately true, thus in the above example the actions which follow
`compound_class::' are only carried out if the host concerned is in
`myclass', is of type `sun4' and the day is Monday!  In the second
example, the host parsing the file must be either of type `sun4' _or_
`ultrix' _or_ `osf'.  In other words, compound classes support two
operators: AND and OR, written `.' and `|' respectively. Cfengine
doesn't care how many of these operators you use (since it skips over
blank class names), so you could write either


     solaris|irix::

or

depending on your taste. On the other hand, the order in which cfengine
evaluates AND and OR operations _does_ matter, and the rule is that AND
takes priority over OR, so that `.' binds classes together tightly and
all AND operations are evaluated before ORing the final results
together. This is the usual behaviour in programming languages. You can
use round parentheses in cfengine classes to override these preferences.

   Cfengine allows you to define switch on and off dummy classes so that
you can use them to select certain subsets of action.  In particular,
note that by defining your own classes, using them to make compound
rules of this type, and then switching them on and off, you can also
switch on and off the corresponding actions in a controlled way.  The
command line options `-D' and `-N' can be used for this purpose.  See
also `addclasses' in the Reference manual.

   A logical NOT operator has been added to allow you to exclude
certain specific hosts in a more flexible way. The logical NOT operator
is (as in C and C++) `!'. For instance, the following example would
allow all hosts except for `myhost':

        ACTION:
     
         !myhost::
     
             COMMAND

and similarly, so allow all hosts in a user-defined group `mygroup',
_except_ for `myhost', you would write

        ACTION:
     
         mygroup.!myhost::
     
             COMMAND

which reads `mygroup AND NOT myhost'. The NOT operator can also be
combined with OR. For instance


        CLASS1|!CLASS2

would select hosts which were either in class 1, or those which were
not in class 2.

   Finally, there is a number of reserved classes.  The following are
hard classes for various operating system architectures.  They do not
need to be defined because each host knows what operating system it is
running.  Thus the appropriate one of these will always be defined on
each host.  Similarly the day of the week is clearly not open to
definition, unless you are running cfengine from outer space.  The
reserved classes are:

     ultrix, sun4, sun3, hpux, hpux10, aix, solaris, osf, irix4, irix, irix64
        sco, freebsd, netbsd, openbsd, bsd4_3, newsos, solarisx86, aos,
               nextstep, bsdos, linux, debian, cray, unix_sv, GnU, NT

If these classes are not sufficient to distinguish the hosts on your
network, cfengine provides more specific classes which contain the name
and release of the operating system. To find out what these look like
for your systems you can run cfengine in `parse-only-verbose' mode:


       cfagent -p -v

and these will be displayed. For example, solaris 2.4 systems generate
the additional classes `sunos_5_4' and `sunos_sun4m', `sunos_sun4m_5_4'.

   Cfengine uses both the unqualified and fully host names as classes.
Some sites and operating systems use fully qualified names for their
hosts. i.e. `uname -n' returns to full domain qualified hostname. This
spoils the class matching algorithms for cfengine, so cfengine
automatically truncates names which contain a dot `.'  at the first `.'
it encounters. If your hostnames contain dots (which do not refer to a
domain name, then cfengine will be confused. The moral is: don't have
dots in your host names! _NOTE: in order to ensure that the fully
qualified name of the host becomes a class you must define the domain
variable._ The dots in this string will be replaced by underscores.

   In summary, the operator ordering in cfengine classes is as follows:

`()'
     Parentheses override everything.

`!'
     The NOT operator binds tightest.

`.'
     The AND operator binds more tightly than OR.

`|'
     OR is the weakest operator.

acl
===


        acl:
     
           CLASS::
     
              { ACL-ALIAS
     
              ACTION
              }

Cfengine's `ACL' feature is a common interface for managing filesystem
access control lists (ACLs). An access control list is an extended file
permission. It allows you to open or close a file to a named list of
users (without having to create a group for those users); similarly, it
allows you to open or close a file for a list of groups.  Several
operating systems have access control lists, but each typically has a
different syntax and different user interface to this facility, making
it very awkward to use.  This part of a cfengine configuration
simplifies the management of ACLs by providing a more convenient user
interface for controlling them and--as far as possible--a common syntax.

   An ACL may, by its very nature, contain a lot of information.
Normally you would set ACLs in a `files' command, *Note files::, or a
`copy' command, *Note copy::. It would be too cumbersome to repeat all
of the information in every command in your configuration, so cfengine
simplifies this by first associating an alias together with a complex
list of ACL information. This alias is then used to represent the whole
bundle of ACL entries in a `files' or `copy' command.  The form of an
ACL is similar to the form of an `editfiles' command.  It is a bundle
of information concerning a file's permissions.


      { ACL-ALIAS
     
       method:overwrite/APPEND
       fstype:POSIX/SOLARIS/DFS/AFS/HPUX/NT
     
       ACL_TYPE:USER/GROUP:PERMISSIONS
       ACL_TYPE:USER/GROUP:PERMISSIONS
       ...
      }

The name ACL-ALIAS can be any identifier containing alphanumeric
characters and underscores. This is what you will use to refer to the
ACL entries in practice. The method entry tells cfengine how to
interpret the entries: should a file's ACLs be overwritten or only
adjusted?  Since the filesystems from different developers all use
different models for ACLs, you must also tell cfengine what kind of
filesystem the file resides on. Currently only solaris and DCE/DFS ACLs
are implemented.

   NOTE: if you set both file permissions and ACLs the file permissions
override the ACLs.

Access control entries
----------------------

   An access control list is build of any number of individual access
control entries (ACEs). The ACEs has the following general syntax:

         ACL_TYPE:USER/GROUP:PERMISSIONS

The user or group is sometimes referred to as a _key_.

   For an explanation of ACL types and their use, refer to your local
manual page.  However, note that for each type of filesystem, there are
certain entries which must exist in an ACL. If you are creating a new
ACL from scratch, you must specify these.  For example, in solaris ACLs
you must have entries for `user', `group' and `other'.  Under DFS you
need what DFS calls a `user_obj', `group_obj' and an `other_obj', and
in some cases `mask_obj'. In cfengine syntax these are called
`user:*:', `other:*:' and `mask:*:', as described below.  If you are
appending to an existing entry, you do not have to re-specify these
unless you want to change them.

   Cfengine can overwrite (replace) or append to one or more ACL
entries.

`overwrite'
     `method:overwrite' is the default. This sets the ACL according to
     the specified entries which follow.  The existing ACL will be
     overwritten completely.

`append'
     `method:append' adds or modifies one or more specified ACL entries.
     If an entry already exists for the specified type and user/group,
     the specified permission bits will be added to the old
     permissions. If there is no ACL entry for the given type and
     user/group, a new entry will be appended.

If the new ACL exactly matches the existing ACL, the ACL is not
replaced.

   The individual bits in an ACE may be either added subtracted or set
equal to a specified mask. The `+' symbol means add, the `-' symbol
subtract and `=' means set equal to.  Here are some examples:

       ACLTYPE:ID/*:MASK
     
       user:mark:+rx,-w
       user:ds:=r
       user:jacobs:noaccess
       user:forgiven:default
     
       user:*:rw
       group:*:r
       other:*:r

The keyword `noaccess' means set all access bits to zero for that user,
i.e. remove all permissions. The keyword `default' means remove the
named user from the access crontrol list altogether, so that the
default permissions apply. A star/asterisk in the centre field
indicates that the user or group ID is implicitly specified as of the
owner of the file, or that no ID is applicable at all (as is the case
for `other').

Solaris ACLs
------------

   Under Solaris, the ACL type can be one of the following:

             user
             group
             mask
             other
             default_user
             default_group
             default_mask
             default_other

A user or group can be specified to the user, group, default_user and
default_group types.  Solaris ACL permissions are the normal UNIX
permissions bits `rwx', where:

         
             R - GRANTS READ PRIVILEGES.
             W - GRANTS WRITE PRIVILEGES.
             X - GRANTS EXECUTE PRIVILEGES.


File: cfengine-Reference.info,  Node: DFS ACLs,  Next: NT ACLs,  Prev: Solaris ACLs,  Up: acl

DFS ACLs
--------

In DCE, the ACL type can be one of the following:

             other
             mask
             any
             unauthenticated
             user
             group
             foreign_other
             foreign_user
             foreign_group

The `user', `group', `foreign_user' and `foreign_group'  types require
that you specify a user or group. The DCE documentation refers to types
`user_obj', `group_obj' and so on. In the cfengine implementation, the
ugly `_obj' suffix has been dropped to make these more in keeping with
the POSIX names. `user_obj::', is equivalent to `user:*:' is cfengine.
The star/asterisk implies that the ACL applies to the owner of the file
object.

   DFS permissions are comprised of the bits `crwxid', where:
             c - Grants control privileges, to modify an acl.
             r - Grants read  privileges.
             w - Grants write privileges.
             x - Grants execute privileges.
             i - Grants insert privileges.
             d - Grants delete privileges.

See the DCE/DFS documentation for more information about this.

   It is not possible to set ACLs in foreign cells currently using
cfengine, but you can still have all of your ACL definitions in the same
file. You must however arrange for the file to be executed on the server
for the cell concerned.  Note also that you must perform a DCE login
(normally as user `cell_admin') in order to set ACLs on files which are
not owned by the owner of the cfengine-process.  This is because you
must have a valid security ticket.


File: cfengine-Reference.info,  Node: NT ACLs,  Next: ACL Example,  Prev: DFS ACLs,  Up: acl

NT ACLs
-------

   NT ACEs are written as follows:
            acl_type:user/group:permissions:accesstype

   The actual change consists of the extra field containing the access
type. A star/asterisk in the field for USER/GROUP would normally imply
that the ACL applies to the owner of the file object. However this
functionality is as of today not yet implemented.

   In NT, the ACL type can be one of the following:
                user
                group
   Both types require that you specify the name of a user or a group.

   NT permissions are comprised of the bits `rwxdpo', where:
         r - Read privileges
         w - Write privileges
         x - Execute privileges
         d - Delete privileges
         p - Privileges to change the permissions on the file
         o - Privileges to take ownership of the file
   In addition to any combination of these bits, the word `noaccess' or
`default' can be used as explained in the previous section. NT comes
with some standard, predefined permissions. The standards are only a
predefined combination of the different bits specified above and are
provided with cfengine as well. You can use the standards by setting the
permission to `read', `change' or `all'. The bit implementation of each
standard is as on NT:
                read   - rx
                change - rwxd
                all    - rwxdpo
   where the bits follow the earlier definition. The keywords mentioned
above can only be used alone, and not in combination with `+', `-', `='
and/or other permission bits.

   NT defines several different access types, of which only two are
used in connection with the ACL type that is implemented in cfengine
for NT. The access type can be one of the following:
                allowed
                denied
   Intuitively, `allowed' access grants the specified permissions to
the user, whilst `denied' denies the user the specified permissions. If
no access type is specified, the default is `allowed'. This enables
cfengine's behaviour as on UNIX systems without any changes to the
configuration file. If the permissions `noaccess' or `default' is used,
the access type will be irrelevant.

ACL Example
===========

   Here is an example of a configuration file for an NT ACL:

     control:
             actionsequence = ( files )
             domain = ( iu.hioslo.no )
     
     files:
             $(HOME)/tt    acl=acl_alias1    action=fixall
     
     acl:
             { acl_alias1
     
             method:overwrite
             fstype:nt
     
             user:gustafb:rwx:allowed
             user:mark:all:allowed
             user:toreo:read:allowed
             user:torej:default:allowed
             user:ds2:+rwx:allowed
     
             group:dummy:all:denied
             group:iu:read:allowed
             group:root:all:allowed

alerts
======

   Alerts are messages that are printed when classes become activated.
Alerts can quote special functions, like `ShowState()'.  Alerts cannot
belong to the class `any'.

     alerts:
     
        class::
     
           QUOTED MESSAGE
           ShowState(PARAMETER)
   For example:


     alerts:
     
       nfsd_in_high_dev2::
     
       "High NFS server access rate 2dev at $(host) value $(value_nfsd_in) av $(average_nfsd_in) pm $(stddev_nfsd_in)"
       ShowState(incoming.nfs)
     
     
     
      # ROOT PROCS
     
       anomaly_hosts.RootProcs_high_dev2::
     
        "RootProc anomaly high 2 dev on $(host) value $(value_rootprocs) av $(average_rootprocs) pm $(stddev_rootprocs)"
       ShowState(procs)

   The `ShowState()' function reports on state gathered by the cfenvd
daemon.
     ShowState(incoming.smtp)
     ShowState(outgoing.smtp)
     ShowState(incoming.www)
     ShowState(outgoing.www)
     ShowState(procs)
     ShowState(users)

binservers
==========

   The `binservers' declaration need only be used if you are using
cfengine's model for mounting NFS filesystems.  This declaration informs
hosts of which other hosts on the network possess filesystems containing
software (binary files) which client hosts should mount.  This includes
resources like programs in `/usr/local' and so on.  A host may have
several binary servers, since there may be several machines to which
disks are physically attached.  In most cases, on a well organized
network, there will be only one _architecture server_ per UNIX platform
type, for instance a SunOS server, an ULTRIX server and so on.

   Binary servers are defined as follows:


     binservers:
     
        physics.sun4::   sunserver sunserver2
        physics.linux::  linuxserver

The meaning of this declaration is the following.  All hosts of type
`sun4' which are members of the group `physics' should mount any
binaries declared in the `mountables' resource list which belong to
hosts `sunserver' or `sunserver2'.  Similarly all `linux' machines
should mount binary filesystems in the mountables list from
`linuxserver'.

   Cfengine knows the difference between binaries and home directories
in the `mountables' list, because home directories match the pattern
given by `homepattern'.  *Note homepattern::.  *Note homeservers::.

   Note that every host is a binary server for itself, so that the first
binary server (and that with highest priority) is always the current
host.  This ensures that local filesystems are always used in preference
to NFS mounted filesystems.  This is only relevant in connection with
the variable `$(binserver)'.


File: cfengine-Reference.info,  Node: broadcast,  Next: control,  Prev: binservers,  Up: Cfagent reference

broadcast
=========

   This information is used to configure the network interface for each
host.

   Every local area network has a convention for determining which
internet address is used for broadcast requests.  Normally this is an
address of the form `aaa.bbb.ccc.255' or `aaa.bbb.ccc.0'.  The
difference between these two forms is whether all of the bits in the
last number are ones or zeroes respectively.  You must find out which
convention is used at your establishment and tell cfengine using a
declaration of the form:

     broadcast:
     
       any::
     
          ones     # or zeros, or zeroes

In most cases you can use the generic class `any', since all of the
hosts on the same subnet have to use the same convention.  If your
configuration file encompasses several different subnets with different
conventions then you will need to use a more specific.

   Cfengine computes the actual value of the broadcast address using the
value specified above and the netmask *Note netmask::.

control
=======

   The fundamental piece of any cfengine script or configuration file is
the control section.  If you omit this part of a cfengine script, it
will not do anything! The control section is used to define certain
variables, set default values and define the order in which the various
actions you have defined will be carried out.  Because cfengine is a
declarative or descriptive language, the order in which actions appear
in the file does not necessarily reflect the order in which they are
executed. The syntax of declarations here is:

       control:
     
          CLASSES::
     
             VARIABLE = ( LIST OR VALUE )

   The control section is a sequence of declarations which looks
something like the following example:


     control:
     
       site     = ( univ )
       domain   = ( univ.edu )
       sysadm   = ( admin@computing.univ.edu )
       netmask  = ( 255.255.252.0 )
       timezone = ( EDT )
       nfstype  = ( nfs )
     
       childlibpath = ( /usr/local:/mylibs )
     
       sensiblesize  = ( 1000 )
       sensiblecount = ( 2 )
       editfilesize  = ( 4000 )
     
       actionsequence =
          (
          links.some
          mountall
          links.others
          files
          )
     
       myvariable = ( something )
       mymacro    = ( somethingelse )

Parentheses are required when making a declaring information in
cfengine.

access
------

   The `access' list is a list of users who are to be allowed to
execute a cfengine program.  If the list does not exist then all users
are allowed to run a program.

        access = ( USER1 USER2 ...  )

The list may consist of either numerical user identifiers or valid
usernames from the password database.  For example:

        access = ( mark aurora 22 456 )

would restrict a script to users mark, aurora and user id 22 and 456.
